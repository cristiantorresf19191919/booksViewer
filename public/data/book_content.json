His books – most notably How to Win Friends and\nInfluence People – have sold tens of millions worldwide and, even in\ntoday’s changing climate, they remain as popular as ever.","By the same author\nHow to Develop Self-confidence and Influence People by Public Speaking\nHow to Enjoy Your Life and Your Job\nHow to Stop Worrying and Start Living\nThe Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking","This book is dedicated to a man\nwho doesn’t need to read it:\nmy cherished friend Homer Croy","EIGHT THINGS THIS BOOK WILL HELP YOU ACHIEVE\nGet out of a mental rut, think new thoughts, acquire new visions, discover new ambitions.\n♦\nMake friends quickly and easily.\n♦\nIncrease your popularity.\n♦\nWin people to your way of thinking.\n♦\nIncrease your influence, your prestige, your ability to get things done.\n♦\nHandle complaints, avoid arguments, keep your human contacts smooth and pleasant.\n♦\nBecome a better speaker, a more entertaining conversationalist.\n♦\nArouse enthusiasm among your associates.\n♦\nThis book has done all these things for more than ten million readers in thirty-six languages.","How to win Friends and Influence People was first published in 1937 in an\nedition of only five thousand copies. Neither Dale Carnegie nor the\npublishers, Simon and Schuster, anticipated more than this modest sale. To\ntheir amazement, the book became an overnight sensation, and edition after\nedition rolled off the presses to keep up with the increasing public demand.\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People took its place in publishing\nhistory as one of the all-time international bestsellers. It touched a nerve\nand filled a human need that was more than a faddish phenomenon of post-\nDepression days, as evidenced by its continued and uninterrupted sales into\nthe eighties, almost half a century later.\nDale Carnegie used to say that it was easier to make a million dollars\nthan to put a phrase into the English language. How to Win Friends and\nInfluence People became such a phrase, quoted, paraphrased, parodied,\nused in innumerable contexts from political cartoon to novels. The book\nitself was translated into almost every known written language. Each\ngeneration has discovered it anew and has found it relevant.\nWhich brings us to the logical question: Why revise a book that has\nproven and continues to prove its vigorous and universal appeal? Why\ntamper with success?\nTo answer that, we must realise that Dale Carnegie himself was a\ntireless reviser of his own work during his lifetime. How to Win Friends\nand Influence People was written to be used as a textbook for his courses in\nEffective Speaking and Human Relations and is still used in those courses\ntoday. Until his death in 1955 he constantly improved and revised the\ncourse itself to make it applicable to the evolving needs of an evergrowing\npublic. No one was more sensitive to the changing currents of present-day\nlife than Dale Carnegie. He constantly improved and refined his methods of\nteaching; he updated his book on Effective Speaking several times. Had he\nlived longer, he himself would have revised How to Win Friends and\nInfluence People to better reflect the changes that have taken place in the\nworld since the thirties.","Many of the names of prominent people in the book, well known at the\ntime of first publication, are no longer recognised by many of today’s\nreaders. Certain examples and phrases seem as quaint and dated in our\nsocial climate as those in a Victorian novel. The important message and\noverall impact of the book is weakened to that extent.\nOur purpose, therefore, in this revision is to clarify and strengthen the\nbook for a modern reader without tampering with the content. We have not\n‘changed’ How to Win Friends and Influence People except to make a few\nexcisions and add a few more contemporary examples. The brash, breezy\nCarnegie style is intact – even the thirties slang is still there. Dale Carnegie\nwrote as he spoke, in an intensively exuberant, colloquial, conversational\nmanner.\nSo his voice still speaks as forcefully as ever, in the book and in his\nwork. Thousands of people all over the world are being trained in Carnegie\ncourses in increasing numbers each year. And other thousands are reading\nand studying How to Win Friends and Influence People and being inspired\nto use its principles to better their lives. To all of them, we offer this\nrevision in the spirit of the honing and polishing of a finely made tool.\nDorothy Carnegie\n(Mrs. Dale Carnegie)","During the first thirty-five years of the twentieth century, the publishing\nhouses of America printed more than a fifth of a million different books.\nMost of them were deadly dull, and many were financial failures. ‘Many,’\ndid I say? The president of one of the largest publishing houses in the world\nconfessed to me that his company, after seventy-five years of publishing\nexperience, still lost money on seven out of every eight books it published.\nWhy, then, did I have the temerity to write another book? And, after I\nhad written it, why should you bother to read it?\nFair questions, both; and I’ll try to answer them.\nI have, since 1912, been conducting educational courses for business\nand professional men and women in New York. At first, I conducted\ncourses in public speaking only – courses designed to train adults, by actual\nexperience, to think on their feet and express their ideas with more clarity,\nmore effectiveness and more poise, both in business interviews and before\ngroups.\nBut gradually, as the seasons passed, I realised that as sorely as these\nadults needed training in effective speaking, they needed still more training\nin the fine art of getting along with people in everyday business and social\ncontacts.\nI also gradually realised that I was sorely in need of such training\nmyself. As I look back across the years, I am appalled at my own frequent\nlack of finesse and understanding. How I wish a book such as this had been\nplaced in my hands twenty years ago! What a priceless boon it would have\nbeen.\nDealing with people is probably the biggest problem you face,\nespecially if you are in business. Yes, and that is also true if you are a\nhousewife, architect or engineer. Research done a few years ago under the\nauspices of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching\nuncovered a most important and significant fact – a fact later confirmed by\nadditional studies made at the Carnegie Institute of Technology. These","investigations revealed that even in such technical lines as engineering,\nabout 15 percent of one’s financial success is due to one’s technical\nknowledge and about 85 percent is due to skill in human engineering – to\npersonality and the ability to lead people.\nFor many years, I conducted courses each season at the Engineers’\nClub of Philadelphia, and also courses for the New York Chapter of the\nAmerican Institute of Electrical Engineers. A total of probably more than\nfifteen hundred engineers have passed through my classes. They came to\nme because they had finally realised, after years of observation and\nexperience, that the highest-paid personnel in engineering are frequently not\nthose who know the most about engineering. One can, for example, hire\nmere technical ability in engineering, accountancy, architecture or any other\nprofession at nominal salaries. But the person who has technical knowledge\nplus the ability to express ideas, to assume leadership, and to arouse\nenthusiasm among people – that person is headed for higher earning power.\nIn the heyday of his activity, John D. Rockefeller said that ‘the ability\nto deal with people is as purchasable a commodity as sugar or coffee.’ ‘And\nI will pay more for that ability,’ said John D., ‘than for any other under the\nsun.’\nWouldn’t you suppose that every college in the land would conduct\ncourses to develop the highest-priced ability under the sun? But if there is\njust one practical, common-sense course of that kind given for adults in\neven one college in the land, it has escaped my attention up to the present\nwriting.\nThe University of Chicago and the United Y.M.C.A. Schools\nconducted a survey to determine what adults want to study.\nThat survey cost $25,000 and took two years. The last part of the\nsurvey was made in Meriden, Connecticut. It had been chosen as a typical\nAmerican town. Every adult in Meriden was interviewed and requested to\nanswer 156 questions – questions such as ‘What is your business or\nprofession? Your education? How do you spend your spare time? What is\nyour income? Your hobbies? Your ambitions? Your problems? What\nsubjects are you most interested in studying?’ And so on. That survey\nrevealed that health is the prime interest of adults – and that their second\ninterest is people; how to understand and get along with people; how to\nmake people like you; and how to win others to your way of thinking.","So the committee conducting this survey resolved to conduct such a\ncourse for adults in Meriden. They searched diligently for a practical\ntextbook on the subject and found – not one. Finally they approached one of\nthe world’s outstanding authorities on adult education and asked him if he\nknew of any book that met the needs of this group. ‘No,’ he replied, ‘I\nknow what those adults want. But the book they need has never been\nwritten.’\nI knew from experience that this statement was true, for I myself had\nbeen searching for years to discover a practical, working handbook on\nhuman relations.\nSince no such book existed, I have tried to write one for use in my own\ncourses. And here it is. I hope you like it.\nIn preparation for this book, I read everything that I could find on the\nsubject – everything from newspaper columns, magazine articles, records of\nthe family courts, the writings of the old philosophers and the new\npsychologists. In addition, I hired a trained researcher to spend one and a\nhalf years in various libraries reading everything I had missed, ploughing\nthrough erudite tomes on psychology, poring over hundreds of magazine\narticles, searching through countless biographies, trying to ascertain how\nthe great leaders of all ages had dealt with people. We read their\nbiographies. We read the life stories of all great leaders from Julius Caesar\nto Thomas Edison. I recall that we read over one hundred biographies of\nTheodore Roosevelt alone. We were determined to spare no time, no\nexpense, to discover every practical idea that anyone had ever used\nthroughout the ages for winning friends and influencing people.\nI personally interviewed scores of successful people, some of them\nworld-famous – inventors like Marconi and Edison; political leaders like\nFranklin D. Roosevelt and James Farley; business leaders like Owen D.\nYoung; movie stars like Clark Gable and Mary Pickford; and explorers like\nMartin Johnson – and tried to discover the techniques they used in human\nrelations.\nFrom all this material, I prepared a short talk. I called it ‘How to Win\nFriends and Influence People.’ I say ‘short.’ It was short in the beginning,\nbut it soon expanded to a lecture that consumed one hour and thirty\nminutes. For years, I gave this talk each season to the adults in the Carnegie\nInstitute courses in New York.","I gave the talk and urged the listeners to go out and test it in their\nbusiness and social contacts, and then come back to class and speak about\ntheir experiences and the results they had achieved. What an interesting\nassignment! These men and women, hungry for self-improvement, were\nfascinated by the idea of working in a new kind of laboratory – the first and\nonly laboratory of human relationships for adults that had ever existed.\nThis book wasn’t written in the usual sense of the word. It grew as a\nchild grows. It grew and developed out of that laboratory, out of the\nexperiences of thousands of adults.\nYears ago, we started with a set of rules printed on a card no larger\nthan a postcard. The next season we printed a larger card, then a leaflet,\nthen a series of booklets, each one expanding in size and scope. After\nfifteen years of experiment and research came this book.\nThe rules we have set down here are not mere theories or guesswork.\nThey work like magic. Incredible as it sounds, I have seen the application of\nthese principles literally revolutionise the lives of many people.\nTo illustrate: A man with 314 employees joined one of these courses.\nFor years, he had driven and criticised and condemned his employees\nwithout stint or discretion. Kindness, words of appreciation and\nencouragement were alien to his lips. After studying the principles\ndiscussed in this book, this employer sharply altered his philosophy of life.\nHis organisation is now inspired with a new loyalty, a new enthusiasm, a\nnew spirit of teamwork. Three hundred and fourteen enemies have been\nturned into 314 friends. As he proudly said in a speech before the class:\n‘When I used to walk through my establishment, no one greeted me. My\nemployees actually looked the other way when they saw me approaching.\nBut now they are all my friends and even the janitor calls me by my first\nname.’\nThis employer gained more profit, more leisure and – what is infinitely\nmore important – he found far more happiness in his business and in his\nhome.\nCountless numbers of salespeople have sharply increased their sales by\nthe use of these principles. Many have opened up new accounts – accounts\nthat they had formerly solicited in vain. Executives have been given\nincreased authority, increased pay. One executive reported a large increase\nin salary because he applied these truths. Another, an executive in the\nPhiladelphia Gas Works Company, was slated for demotion when he was","sixty-five because of his belligerence, because of his inability to lead people\nskillfully. This training not only saved him from the demotion but brought\nhim a promotion with increased pay.\nOn innumerable occasions, spouses attending the banquet given at the\nend of the course have told me that their homes have been much happier\nsince their husbands or wives started this training.\nPeople are frequently astonished at the new results they achieve. It all\nseems like magic. In some cases, in their enthusiasm, they have telephoned\nme at my home on Sundays because they couldn’t wait forty-eight hours to\nreport on their achievements at the regular session of the course.\nOne man was so stirred by a talk on these principles that he sat far into\nthe night discussing them with other members of the class. At three o’clock\nin the morning, the others went home. But he was so shaken by a realisation\nof his own mistakes, so inspired by the vista of a new and richer world\nopening before him, that he was unable to sleep. He didn’t sleep that night\nor the next day or the next night.\nWho was he? A naïve, untrained individual ready to gush over any\nnew theory that came along? No. Far from it. He was a sophisticated, blasé\ndealer in art, very much the man about town, who spoke three languages\nfluently and was a graduate of two European universities.\nWhile writing this chapter, I received a letter from a German of the old\nschool, an aristocrat whose forebears had served for generations as\nprofessional army officers under the Hohenzollerns. His letter, written from\na transatlantic steamer, telling about the application of these principles, rose\nalmost to a religious fervor.\nAnother man, an old New Yorker, a Harvard graduate, a wealthy man,\nthe owner of a large carpet factory, declared he had learned more in\nfourteen weeks through this system of training about the fine art of\ninfluencing people than he had learned about the same subject during his\nfour years in college. Absurd? Laughable? Fantastic? Of course, you are\nprivileged to dismiss this statement with whatever adjective you wish. I am\nmerely reporting, without comment, a declaration made by a conservative\nand eminently successful Harvard graduate in a public address to\napproximately six hundred people at the Yale Club in New York on the\nevening of Thursday, February 23, 1933.\n‘Compared to what we ought to be,’ said the famous Professor William\nJames of Harvard, ‘compared to what we ought to be, we are only half","awake. We are making use of only a small part of our physical and mental\nresources. Stating the thing broadly, the human individual thus lives far\nwithin his limits. He possesses powers of various sorts which he habitually\nfails to use.’\nThose powers which you ‘habitually fail to use’! The sole purpose of\nthis book is to help you discover, develop and profit by those dormant and\nunused assets.\n‘Education,’ said Dr. John G. Hibben, former president of Princeton\nUniversity, ‘is the ability to meet life’s situations.’\nIf by the time you have finished reading the first three chapters of this\nbook – if you aren’t then a little better equipped to meet life’s situations,\nthen I shall consider this book to be a total failure so far as you are\nconcerned. For ‘the great aim of education,’ said Herbert Spencer, ‘is not\nknowledge but action.’\nAnd this is an action book.\nDale Carnegie 1936","NINE SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF\nTHIS BOOK\n1. If you wish to get the most out of this book, there is one\nindispensable requirement, one essential infinitely more important than\nany rule or technique. Unless you have this one fundamental requisite,\na thousand rules on how to study will avail little. And if you do have\nthis cardinal endowment, then you can achieve wonders without\nreading any suggestions for getting the most out of a book.\nWhat is this magic requirement? Just this: a deep, driving desire\nto learn, a vigorous determination to increase your ability to deal with\npeople.\nHow can you develop such an urge? By constantly reminding\nyourself how important these principles are to you. Picture to yourself\nhow their mastery will aid you in leading a richer, fuller, happier and\nmore fulfilling life. Say to yourself over and over: ‘My popularity, my\nhappiness and sense of worth depend to no small extent upon my skill\nin dealing with people.’\n2. Read each chapter rapidly at first to get a bird’s-eye view of it. You\nwill probably be tempted then to rush on to the next one. But don’t –\nunless you are reading merely for entertainment. But if you are reading\nbecause you want to increase your skill in human relations, then go\nback and reread each chapter thoroughly. In the long run, this will\nmean saving time and getting results.\n3. Stop frequently in your reading to think over what you are reading.\nAsk yourself just how and when you can apply each suggestion.\n4. Read with a crayon, pencil, pen, magic marker or highlighter in your\nhand. When you come across a suggestion that you feel you can use,\ndraw a line beside it. If it is a four-star suggestion, then underscore\nevery sentence or highlight it, or mark it with ‘****.’ Marking and\nunderscoring a book makes it more interesting, and far easier to review\nrapidly.","5. I knew a woman who had been office manager for a large insurance\nconcern for fifteen years. Every month, she read all the insurance\ncontracts her company had issued that month. Yes, she read many of\nthe same contracts over month after month, year after year. Why?\nBecause experience had taught her that that was the only way she\ncould keep their provisions clearly in mind.\nI once spent almost two years writing a book on public speaking\nand yet I found I had to keep going back over it from time to time in\norder to remember what I had written in my own book. The rapidity\nwith which we forget is astonishing.\nSo, if you want to get a real, lasting benefit out of this book, don’t\nimagine that skimming through it once will suffice. After reading it\nthoroughly, you ought to spend a few hours reviewing it every month.\nKeep it on your desk in front of you every day. Glance through it\noften. Keep constantly impressing yourself with the rich possibilities\nfor improvement that still lie in the offing. Remember that the use of\nthese principles can be made habitual only by a constant and vigorous\ncampaign of review and application. There is no other way.\n6. Bernard Shaw once remarked: ‘If you teach a man anything, he will\nnever learn.’ Shaw was right. Learning is an active process. We learn\nby doing. So, if you desire to master the principles you are studying in\nthis book, do something about them. Apply these rules at every\nopportunity. If you don’t you will forget them quickly. Only\nknowledge that is used sticks in your mind.\nYou will probably find it difficult to apply these suggestions all\nthe time. I know because I wrote the book, and yet frequently I found\nit difficult to apply everything I advocated. For example, when you are\ndispleased, it is much easier to criticise and condemn than it is to try to\nunderstand the other person’s viewpoint. It is frequently easier to find\nfault than to find praise. It is more natural to talk about what you want\nthan to talk about what the other person wants. And so on. So, as you\nread this book, remember that you are not merely trying to acquire\ninformation. You are attempting to form new habits. Ah yes, you are\nattempting a new way of life. That will require time and persistence\nand daily application.","So refer to these pages often. Regard this as a working handbook\non human relations; and whenever you are confronted with some\nspecific problem – such as handling a child, winning your spouse to\nyour way of thinking, or satisfying an irritated customer – hesitate\nabout doing the natural thing, the impulsive thing. This is usually\nwrong. Instead, turn to these pages and review the paragraphs you\nhave underscored. Then try these new ways and watch them achieve\nmagic for you.\n7. Offer your spouse, your child or some business associate a dime or a\ndollar every time he or she catches you violating a certain principle.\nMake a lively game out of mastering these rules.\n8. The president of an important Wall Street bank once described, in a\ntalk before one of my classes, a highly efficient system he used for\nself-improvement. This man had little formal schooling; yet he had\nbecome one of the most important financiers in America, and he\nconfessed that he owed most of his success to the constant application\nof his homemade system. This is what he does. I’ll put it in his own\nwords as accurately as I can remember.\n‘For years I have kept an engagement book showing all the\nappointments I had during the day. My family never made any plans\nfor me on Saturday night, for the family knew that I devoted a part of\neach Saturday evening to the illuminating process of self-examination\nand review and appraisal. After dinner I went off by myself, opened\nmy engagement book, and thought over all the interviews, discussions\nand meetings that had taken place during the week. I asked myself:\n‘“What mistakes did I make that time?”\n‘“What did I do that was right – and in what way could I have\nimproved my performance?”\n‘“What lessons can I learn from that experience?”\n‘I often found that this weekly review made me very unhappy. I\nwas frequently astonished at my own blunders. Of course, as the years\npassed, these blunders became less frequent. Sometimes I was inclined\nto pat myself on the back a little after one of these sessions. This\nsystem of self-analysis, self-education, continued year after year, did\nmore for me than any other one thing I have ever attempted.","‘It helped me improve my ability to make decisions – and it aided\nme enormously in all my contacts with people. I cannot recommend it\ntoo highly.’\nWhy not use a similar system to check up on your application of\nthe principles discussed in this book? If you do, two things will result.\nFirst, you will find yourself engaged in an educational process\nthat is both intriguing and priceless.\nSecond, you will find that your ability to meet and deal with\npeople will grow enormously.\n9. You will find at the end of this book several blank pages on which\nyou should record your triumphs in the application of these principles.\nBe specific. Give names, dates, results. Keeping such a record will\ninspire you to greater efforts; and how fascinating these entries will be\nwhen you chance upon them some evening years from now!\nIn order to get the most out of this book:\na. Develop a deep, driving desire to master the principles of human\nrelations.\nb. Read each chapter twice before going on to the next one.\nc. As you read, stop frequently to ask yourself how you can apply each\nsuggestion.\nd. Underscore each important idea.\ne. Review this book each month.\nf. Apply these principles at every opportunity. Use this volume as a\nworking handbook to help you solve your daily problems.\ng. Make a lively game out of your learning by offering some friend a\ndime or a dollar every time he or she catches you violating one of\nthese principles.\nh. Check up each week on the progress you are making. Ask yourself\nwhat mistakes you have made, what improvement, what lessons you\nhave learned for the future.\ni. Keep notes in the back of this book showing how and when you have\napplied these principles.","ON MAY 7, 1931, the most sensational manhunt New York City had ever\nknown had come to its climax. After weeks of search, ‘Two Gun’ Crowley\n– the killer, the gunman who didn’t smoke or drink – was at bay, trapped in\nhis sweetheart’s apartment on West End Avenue.\nOne hundred and fifty policemen and detectives laid siege to his top-\nfloor hideaway. They chopped holes in the roof; they tried to smoke out\nCrowley, the ‘cop killer,’ with teargas. Then they mounted their machine\nguns on surrounding buildings, and for more than an hour one of New\nYork’s fine residential areas reverberated with the crack of pistol fire and\nthe rat-tat-tat of machine guns. Crowley, crouching behind an overstuffed\nchair, fired incessantly at the police. Ten thousand excited people watched\nthe battle. Nothing like it had ever been seen before on the sidewalks of\nNew York.\nWhen Crowley was captured, Police Commissioner E.P. Mulrooney\ndeclared that the two-gun desperado was one of the most dangerous\ncriminals ever encountered in the history of New York. ‘He will kill,’ said\nthe Commissioner, ‘at the drop of a feather.’\nBut how did ‘Two Gun’ Crowley regard himself? We know, because\nwhile the police were firing into his apartment, he wrote a letter addressed\n‘To whom it may concern.’ And, as he wrote, the blood flowing from his\nwounds left a crimson trail on the paper. In this letter Crowley said: ‘Under\nmy coat is a weary heart, but a kind one – one that would do nobody any\nharm.’\nA short time before this, Crowley had been having a necking party\nwith his girl friend on a country road out on Long Island. Suddenly a\npoliceman walked up to the car and said: ‘Let me see your license.’\nWithout saying a word, Crowley drew his gun and cut the policeman\ndown with a shower of lead. As the dying officer fell, Crowley leaped out","of the car, grabbed the officer’s revolver, and fired another bullet into the\nprostrate body. And that was the killer who said: ‘Under my coat is a weary\nheart, but a kind one – one that would do nobody any harm.’\nCrowley was sentenced to the electric chair. When he arrived at the\ndeath house in Sing Sing, did he say, ‘This is what I get for killing people’?\nNo, he said: ‘This is what I get for defending myself.’\nThe point of the story is this: ‘Two Gun’ Crowley didn’t blame himself\nfor anything.\nIs that an unusual attitude among criminals? If you think so, listen to\nthis:\n‘I have spent the best years of my life giving people the lighter\npleasures, helping them have a good time, and all I get is abuse, the\nexistence of a hunted man.’\nThat’s Al Capone speaking. Yes, America’s most notorious Public\nEnemy – the most sinister gang leader who ever shot up Chicago. Capone\ndidn’t condemn himself. He actually regarded himself as a public\nbenefactor – an unappreciated and misunderstood public benefactor.\nAnd so did Dutch Schultz before he crumpled up under gangster\nbullets in Newark. Dutch Schultz, one of New York’s most notorious rats,\nsaid in a newspaper interview that he was a public benefactor. And he\nbelieved it.\nI have had some interesting correspondence with Lewis Lawes, who\nwas warden of New York’s infamous Sing Sing prison for many years, on\nthis subject, and he declared that ‘few of the criminals in Sing Sing regard\nthemselves as bad men. They are just as human as you and I. So they\nrationalise, they explain. They can tell you why they had to crack a safe or\nbe quick on the trigger finger. Most of them attempt by a form of reasoning,\nfallacious or logical, to justify their antisocial acts even to themselves,\nconsequently stoutly maintaining that they should never have been\nimprisoned at all.’\nIf Al Capone, ‘Two Gun’ Crowley, Dutch Schultz, and the desperate\nmen and women behind prison walls don’t blame themselves for anything –\nwhat about the people with whom you and I come in contact?\nJohn Wanamaker, founder of the American stores that bear his name,\nonce confessed: ‘I learned thirty years ago that it is foolish to scold. I have\nenough trouble overcoming my own limitations without fretting over the\nfact that God has not seen fit to distribute evenly the gift of intelligence.’","Wanamaker learned this lesson early, but I personally had to blunder\nthrough this old world for a third of a century before it even began to dawn\nupon me that ninety-nine times out of a hundred, people don’t criticise\nthemselves for anything no matter how wrong it may be.\nCriticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually\nmakes him strive to justify himself. Criticism is dangerous, because it\nwounds a person’s precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and\narouses resentment.\nB.F. Skinner, the world-famous psychologist, proved through his\nexperiments that an animal rewarded for good behaviour will learn much\nmore rapidly and retain what it learns far more effectively than an animal\npunished for bad behaviour. Later studies have shown that the same applies\nto humans. By criticising, we do not make lasting changes and often incur\nresentment.\nHans Selye, another great psychologist, said, ‘As much as we thirst for\napproval, we dread condemnation.’\nThe resentment that criticism engenders can demoralise employees,\nfamily members and friends, and still not correct the situation that has been\ncondemned.\nGeorge B. Johnston of Enid, Oklahoma, is the safety coordinator for an\nengineering company. One of his responsibilities is to see that employees\nwear their hard hats whenever they are on the job in the field. He reported\nthat whenever he came across workers who were not wearing hard hats, he\nwould tell them with a lot of authority of the regulation and that they must\ncomply. As a result he would get sullen acceptance, and often after he left,\nthe workers would remove the hats.\nHe decided to try a different approach. The next time he found some of\nthe workers not wearing their hard hat, he asked if the hats were\nuncomfortable or did not fit properly. Then he reminded the men in a\npleasant tone of voice that the hat was designed to protect them from injury\nand suggested that it always be worn on the job. The result was increased\ncompliance with the regulation with no resentment or emotional upset.\nYou will find examples of the futility of criticism bristling on a\nthousand pages of history. Take, for example, the famous quarrel between\nTheodore Roosevelt and President Taft – a quarrel that split the Republican\nparty, put Woodrow Wilson in the White House, and wrote bold, luminous\nlines across the First World War and altered the flow of history. Let’s","review the facts quickly. When Theodore Roosevelt stepped out of the\nWhite House in 1908, he supported Taft, who was elected President. Then\nTheodore Roosevelt went off to Africa to shoot lions. When he returned, he\nexploded. He denounced Taft for his conservatism, tried to secure the\nnomination for a third term himself, formed the Bull Moose party, and all\nbut demolished the G.O.P. In the election that followed, William Howard\nTaft and the Republican party carried only two states – Vermont and Utah.\nThe most disastrous defeat the party had ever known.\nTheodore Roosevelt blamed Taft, but did President Taft blame\nhimself? Of course not. With tears in his eyes, Taft said: ‘I don’t see how I\ncould have done any differently from what I have.’\nWho was to blame? Roosevelt or Taft? Frankly, I don’t know, and I\ndon’t care. The point I am trying to make is that all of Theodore Roosevelt’s\ncriticism didn’t persuade Taft that he was wrong. It merely made Taft strive\nto justify himself and to reiterate with tears in his eyes: ‘I don’t see how I\ncould have done any differently from what I have.’\nOr, take the Teapot Dome oil scandal. It kept the newspapers ringing\nwith indignation in the early 1920s. It rocked the nation! Within the\nmemory of living men, nothing like it had ever happened before in\nAmerican public life. Here are the bare facts of the scandal: Albert B. Fall,\nsecretary of the interior in Harding’s cabinet, was entrusted with the leasing\nof government oil reserves at Elk Hill and Teapot Dome – oil reserves that\nhad been set aside for the future use of the Navy. Did Secretary Fall permit\ncompetitive bidding? No sir. He handed the fat, juicy contract outright to\nhis friend Edward L. Doheny. And what did Doheny do? He gave Secretary\nFall what he was pleased to call a ‘loan’ of one hundred thousand dollars.\nThen, in a high-handed manner, Secretary Fall ordered United States\nMarines into the district to drive off competitors whose adjacent wells were\nsapping oil out of the Elk Hill reserves. These competitors, driven off their\nground at the ends of guns and bayonets, rushed into court – and blew the\nlid off the Teapot Dome scandal. A stench arose so vile that it ruined the\nHarding Administration, nauseated an entire nation, threatened to wreck the\nRepublican party, and put Albert B. Fall behind prison bars.\nFall was condemned viciously – condemned as few men in public life\nhave ever been. Did he repent? Never! Years later Herbert Hoover intimated\nin a public speech that President Harding’s death had been due to mental\nanxiety and worry because a friend had betrayed him. When Mrs. Fall heard","that, she sprang from her chair, she wept, she shook her fists at fate and\nscreamed: ‘What! Harding betrayed by Fall? No! My husband never\nbetrayed anyone. This whole house full of gold would not tempt my\nhusband to do wrong. He is the one who has been betrayed and led to the\nslaughter and crucified.’\nThere you are; human nature in action, wrongdoers, blaming\neverybody but themselves. We are all like that. So when you and I are\ntempted to criticise someone tomorrow, let’s remember Al Capone, ‘Two\nGun’ Crowley and Albert Fall. Let’s realise that criticisms are like homing\npigeons. They always return home. Let’s realise that the person we are\ngoing to correct and condemn will probably justify himself or herself, and\ncondemn us in return; or, like the gentle Taft, will say: ‘I don’t see how I\ncould have done any differently from what I have.’\nOn the morning of April 15, 1865, Abraham Lincoln lay dying in a\nhall bedroom of a cheap lodging house directly across the street from Ford’s\nTheatre, where John Wilkes Booth had shot him. Lincoln’s long body lay\nstretched diagonally across a sagging bed that was too short for him. A\ncheap reproduction of Rosa Bonheur’s famous painting The Horse Fair\nhung above the bed, and a dismal gas jet flickered yellow light.\nAs Lincoln lay dying, Secretary of War Stanton said, ‘There lies the\nmost perfect ruler of men that the world has ever seen.’\nWhat was the secret of Lincoln’s success in dealing with people? I\nstudied the life of Abraham Lincoln for ten years and devoted all of three\nyears to writing and rewriting a book entitled Lincoln the Unknown. I\nbelieve I have made as detailed and exhaustive study of Lincoln’s\npersonality and home life as it is possible for any being to make. I made a\nspecial study of Lincoln’s method of dealing with people. Did he indulge in\ncriticism? Oh, yes. As a young man in the Pigeon Creek Valley of Indiana,\nhe not only criticised but he wrote letters and poems ridiculing people and\ndropped these letters on the country roads where they were sure to be\nfound. One of these letters aroused resentments that burned for a lifetime.\nEven after Lincoln had become a practising lawyer in Springfield,\nIllinois, he attacked his opponents openly in letters published in the\nnewspapers. But he did this just once too often.\nIn the autumn of 1842 he ridiculed a vain, pugnacious politician by the\nname of James Shields. Lincoln lampooned him through an anonymous\nletter published in the Springfield Journal. The town roared with laughter.","Shields, sensitive and proud, boiled with indignation. He found out who\nwrote the letter, leaped on his horse, started after Lincoln, and challenged\nhim to fight a duel. Lincoln didn’t want to fight. He was opposed to\nduelling, but he couldn’t get out of it and save his honour. He was given the\nchoice of weapons. Since he had very long arms, he chose cavalry\nbroadswords and took lessons in sword fighting from a West Point\ngraduate; and, on the appointed day, he and Shields met on a sandbar in the\nMississippi River, prepared to fight to the death; but, at the last minute,\ntheir seconds interrupted and stopped the duel.\nThat was the most lurid personal incident in Lincoln’s life. It taught\nhim an invaluable lesson in the art of dealing with people. Never again did\nhe write an insulting letter. Never again did he ridicule anyone. And from\nthat time on, he almost never criticised anybody for anything.\nTime after time, during the Civil War, Lincoln put a new general at the\nhead of the Army of the Potomac, and each one in turn – McClellan, Pope,\nBurnside, Hooker, Meade – blundered tragically and drove Lincoln to\npacing the floor in despair. Half the nation savagely condemned these\nincompetent generals, but Lincoln, ‘with malice toward none, with charity\nfor all,’ held his peace. One of his favourite quotations was ‘Judge not, that\nye be not judged.’\nAnd when Mrs Lincoln and others spoke harshly of the southern\npeople, Lincoln replied: ‘Don’t criticise them; they are just what we would\nbe under similar circumstances.’\nYet if any man ever had occasion to criticise, surely it was Lincoln.\nLet’s take just one illustration:\nThe Battle of Gettysburg was fought during the first three days of July\n1863. During the night of July 4, Lee began to retreat southward while\nstorm clouds deluged the country with rain. When Lee reached the Potomac\nwith his defeated army, he found a swollen, impassable river in front of\nhim, and a victorious Union Army behind him. Lee was in a trap. He\ncouldn’t escape. Lincoln saw that. Here was a golden, heaven-sent\nopportunity – the opportunity to capture Lee’s army and end the war\nimmediately. So, with a surge of hope, Lincoln ordered Meade not to call a\ncouncil of war but to attack Lee immediately. Lincoln telegraphed his\norders and then sent a special messenger to Meade demanding immediate\naction.","And what did General Meade do? He did the very opposite of what he\nwas told to do. He called a council of war in direct violation of Lincoln’s\norders. He hesitated. He procrastinated. He telegraphed all manner of\nexcuses. He refused point-blank to attack Lee. Finally the waters receded\nand Lee escaped over the Potomac with his forces.\nLincoln was furious. ‘What does this mean?’ Lincoln cried to his son\nRobert. ‘Great God! What does this mean? We had them within our grasp,\nand had only to stretch forth our hands and they were ours; yet nothing that\nI could say or do could make the army move. Under the circumstances,\nalmost any general could have defeated Lee. If I had gone up there, I could\nhave whipped him myself.’\nIn bitter disappointment, Lincoln sat down and wrote Meade this letter.\nAnd remember, at this period of his life Lincoln was extremely conservative\nand restrained in his phraseology. So this letter coming from Lincoln in\n1863 was tantamount to the severest rebuke.\nMy dear General,\nI do not believe you appreciate the magnitude of the\nmisfortune involved in Lee’s escape. He was within our easy\ngrasp, and to have closed upon him would, in connection with\nour other late successes, have ended the war. As it is, the war\nwill be prolonged indefinitely. If you could not safely attack\nLee last Monday, how can you possibly do so south of the\nriver, when you can take with you very few – no more than\ntwo-thirds of the force you then had in hand? It would be\nunreasonable to expect and I do not expect that you can now\neffect much. Your golden opportunity is gone, and I am\ndistressed immeasurably because of it.\nWhat do you suppose Meade did when he read the letter?\nMeade never saw that letter. Lincoln never mailed it. It was found\namong his papers after his death.\nMy guess is – and this is only a guess – that after writing that letter,\nLincoln looked out of the window and said to himself, ‘Just a minute.\nMaybe I ought not to be so hasty. It is easy enough for me to sit here in the\nquiet of the White House and order Meade to attack; but if I had been up at\nGettysburg, and if I had seen as much blood as Meade has seen during the","last week, and if my ears had been pierced with the screams and shrieks of\nthe wounded and dying, maybe I wouldn’t be so anxious to attack either. If I\nhad Meade’s timid temperament, perhaps I would have done just what he\nhad done. Anyhow, it is water under the bridge now. If I send this letter, it\nwill relieve my feelings, but it will make Meade try to justify himself. It\nwill make him condemn me. It will arouse hard feelings, impair all his\nfurther usefulness as a commander, and perhaps force him to resign from\nthe army.’\nSo, as I have already said, Lincoln put the letter aside, for he had\nlearned by bitter experience that sharp criticisms and rebukes almost\ninvariably end in futility.\nTheodore Roosevelt said that when he, as President, was confronted\nwith a perplexing problem, he used to lean back and look up at a large\npainting of Lincoln which hung above his desk in the White House and ask\nhimself, ‘What would Lincoln do if he were in my shoes? How would he\nsolve this problem?’\nMark Twain lost his temper occasionally and wrote letters that turned\nthe paper brown. For example, he once wrote to a man who had aroused his\nire: ‘The thing for you is a burial permit. You have only to speak and I will\nsee that you get it.’ On another occasion he wrote to an editor about a\nproofreader’s attempts to ‘improve my spelling and punctuation.’ He\nordered: ‘Set the matter according to my copy hereafter and see that the\nproofreader retains his suggestions in the mush of his decayed brain.’\nThe writing of these stinging letters made Mark Twain feel better.\nThey allowed him to blow off steam, and the letters didn’t do any real harm,\nbecause Mark’s wife secretly lifted them out of the mail. They were never\nsent.\nDo you know someone you would like to change and regulate and\nimprove? Good! That is fine. I am all in favour of it. But why not begin on\nyourself? From a purely selfish standpoint, that is a lot more profitable than\ntrying to improve others – yes, and a lot less dangerous. ‘Don’t complain\nabout the snow on your neighbour’s roof,’ said Confucious, ‘when your\nown doorstep is unclean.’\nWhen I was still young and trying to impress people, I wrote a foolish\nletter to Richard Harding Davis, an author who once loomed large on the\nliterary horizon of America. I was preparing a magazine article about\nauthors, and I asked Davis to tell me about his method of work. A few","weeks earlier, I had received a letter from someone with this notation at the\nbottom: ‘Dictated but not read.’ I was quite impressed. I felt that the writer\nmust be very big and busy and important. I wasn’t the slightest bit busy, but\nI was eager to make an impression on Richard Harding Davis, so I ended\nmy short note with the words: ‘Dictated but not read.’\nHe never troubled to answer the letter. He simply returned it to me\nwith this scribbled across the bottom: ‘Your bad manners are exceeded only\nby your bad manners.’ True, I had blundered, and perhaps I deserved this\nrebuke. But, being human, I resented it. I resented it so sharply that when I\nread of the death of Richard Harding Davis ten years later, the one thought\nthat still persisted in my mind – I am ashamed to admit – was the hurt he\nhad given me.\nIf you and I want to stir up a resentment tomorrow that may rankle\nacross the decades and endure until death, just let us indulge in a little\nstinging criticism – no matter how certain we are that it is justified.\nWhen dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with\ncreatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures\nbristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.\nBitter criticism caused the sensitive Thomas Hardy, one of the finest\nnovelists ever to enrich English literature, to give up forever the writing of\nfiction. Criticism drove Thomas Chatterton, the English poet, to suicide.\nBenjamin Franklin, tactless in his youth, became so diplomatic, so\nadroit at handling people, that he was made American Ambassador to\nFrance. The secret of his success? ‘I will speak ill of no man,’ he said, ‘. . .\nand speak all the good I know of everybody.’\nAny fool can criticise, condemn and complain – and most fools do.\nBut it takes character and self-control to be understanding and\nforgiving.\n‘A great man shows his greatness,’ said Carlyle, ‘by the way he treats\nlittle men.’\nBob Hoover, a famous test pilot and frequent performer at air shows,\nwas returning to his home in Los Angeles from an air show in San Diego.\nAs described in the magazine Flight Operations, at three hundred feet in the\nair, both engines suddenly stopped. By deft manoeuvring he managed to\nland the plane, but it was badly damaged although nobody was hurt.\nHoover’s first act after the emergency landing was to inspect the\naeroplane’s fuel. Just as he suspected, the World War II propeller plane he","had been flying had been fuelled with jet fuel rather than gasoline.\nUpon returning to the airport, he asked to see the mechanic who had\nserviced his aeroplane. The young man was sick with the agony of his\nmistake. Tears streamed down his face as Hoover approached. He had just\ncaused the loss of a very expensive plane and could have caused the loss of\nthree lives as well.\nYou can imagine Hoover’s anger. One could anticipate the tongue-\nlashing that this proud and precise pilot would unleash for that carelessness.\nBut Hoover didn’t scold the mechanic; he didn’t even criticise him. Instead,\nhe put his big arm around the man’s shoulder and said, ‘To show you I’m\nsure that you’ll never do this again, I want you to service my F-51\ntomorrow.’\nOften parents are tempted to criticise their children. You would expect\nme to say ‘don’t.’ But I will not. I am merely going to say, ‘Before you\ncriticise them, read one of the classics of American journalism, “Father\nForgets.”’ It originally appeared as an editorial in the People’s Home\nJournal. We are reprinting it here with the author’s permission, as\ncondensed in the Reader’s Digest:\n‘Father Forgets’ is one of those little pieces which – dashed off in a\nmoment of sincere feeling – strikes an echoing chord in so many readers as\nto become a perennial reprint favourite. Since its first appearance, ‘Father\nForgets’ has been reproduced, writes the author, W. Livingstone Larned, ‘in\nhundreds of magazines and house organs, and in newspapers the country\nover. It has been reprinted almost as extensively in many foreign languages.\nI have given personal permission to thousands who wished to read it from\nschool, church, and lecture platforms. It has been “on the air” on countless\noccasions and programmes. Oddly enough, college periodicals have used it,\nand high-school magazines. Sometimes a little piece seems mysteriously to\n“click.” This one certainly did.’\nFATHER FORGETS\nW. Livingston Larned\nListen, son: I am saying this as you lie asleep, one little paw\ncrumpled under your cheek and the blond curls stickily wet\non your damp forehead. I have stolen into your room alone.\nJust a few minutes ago, as I sat reading my paper in the","library, a stifling wave of remorse swept over me. Guiltily I\ncame to your bedside.\nThere are the things I was thinking, son: I had been cross\nto you. I scolded you as you were dressing for school because\nyou gave your face merely a dab with a towel. I took you to\ntask for not cleaning your shoes. I called out angrily when you\nthrew some of your things on the floor.\nAt breakfast I found fault, too. You spilled things. You\ngulped down your food. You put your elbows on the table. You\nspread butter too thick on your bread. And as you started off\nto play and I made for my train, you turned and waved a\nhand and called, ‘Goodbye, Daddy!’ and I frowned, and said\nin reply, ‘Hold your shoulders back!’\nThen it began all over again in the late afternoon. As I\ncame up the road I spied you, down on your knees, playing\nmarbles. There were holes in your stockings. I humiliated you\nbefore your boyfriends by marching you ahead of me to the\nhouse. Stockings were expensive – and if you had to buy them\nyou would be more careful! Imagine that, son, from a father!\nDo you remember, later, when I was reading in the\nlibrary, how you came in timidly, with a sort of hurt look in\nyour eyes? When I glanced up over my paper, impatient at the\ninterruption, you hesitated at the door. ‘What is it you want?’\nI snapped.\nYou said nothing, but ran across in one tempestuous\nplunge, and threw your arms around my neck and kissed me,\nand your small arms tightened with an affection that God had\nset blooming in your heart and which even neglect could not\nwither. And then you were gone, pattering up the stairs.\nWell, son, it was shortly afterwards that my paper\nslipped from my hands and a terrible sickening fear came\nover me. What has habit been doing to me? The habit of\nfinding fault, of reprimanding – this was my reward to you\nfor being a boy. It was not that I did not love you; it was that I\nexpected too much of youth. I was measuring you by the\nyardstick of my own years.","And there was so much that was good and fine and true\nin your character. The little heart of you was as big as the\ndawn itself over the wide hills. This was shown by your\nspontaneous impulse to rush in and kiss me good night.\nNothing else matters tonight, son. I have come to your bedside\nin the darkness, and I have knelt there, ashamed!\nIt is a feeble atonement; I know you would not\nunderstand these things if I told them to you during your\nwaking hours. But tomorrow I will be a real daddy! I will\nchum with you, and suffer when you suffer, and laugh when\nyou laugh. I will bite my tongue when impatient words come.\nI will keep saying as if it were a ritual: ‘He is nothing but a\nboy – a little boy!’\nI am afraid I have visualized you as a man. Yet as I see\nyou now, son, crumpled and weary in your cot, I see that you\nare still a baby. Yesterday you were in your mother’s arms,\nyour head on her shoulder. I have asked too much, too much.\nInstead of condemning people, let’s try to understand them. Let’s try to\nfigure out why they do what they do. That’s a lot more profitable and\nintriguing than criticism; and it breeds sympathy, tolerance and kindness.\n‘To know all is to forgive all.’\nAs Dr. Johnson said: ‘God himself, sir, does not propose to judge man\nuntil the end of his days.’\nWhy should you and I?\nPRINCIPLE 1\nDon’t criticise, condemn or complain.","THERE IS ONLY one way under high heaven to get anybody to do anything.\nDid you ever stop to think of that? Yes, just one way. And that is by making\nthe other person want to do it.\nRemember, there is no other way.\nOf course, you can make someone want to give you his watch by\nsticking a revolver in his ribs. You can make your employees give you\ncooperation – until your back is turned – by threatening to fire them. You\ncan make a child do what you want it to do by a whip or a threat. But these\ncrude methods have sharply undesirable repercussions.\nThe only way I can get you to do anything is by giving you what you\nwant.\nWhat do you want?\nSigmund Freud said that everything you and I do springs from two\nmotives: the sex urge and the desire to be great.\nJohn Dewey, one of America’s most profound philosophers, phrased it\na bit differently. Dr. Dewey said that the deepest urge in human nature is\n‘the desire to be important.’ Remember that phrase: ‘the desire to be\nimportant.’ It is significant. You are going to hear a lot about it in this book.\nWhat do you want? Not many things, but the few things that you do\nwish, you crave with an insistence that will not be denied. Some of the\nthings most people want include:\n1 Health and the preservation of life.\n2 Food.\n3 Sleep.\n4 Money and the things money will buy.\n5 Life in the hereafter.\n6 Sexual gratification.\n7 The well-being of our children.","8 A feeling of importance.\nAlmost all these wants are usually gratified – all except one. But there is\none longing – almost as deep, almost as imperious, as the desire for food or\nsleep – which is seldom gratified. It is what Freud calls ‘the desire to be\ngreat.’ It is what Dewey calls the ‘desire to be important.’\nLincoln once began a letter saying: ‘Everybody likes a compliment.’\nWilliam James said: ‘The deepest principle in human nature is the craving\nto be appreciated.’ He didn’t speak, mind you, of the ‘wish’ or the ‘desire’\nor the ‘longing’ to be appreciated. He said the ‘craving’ to be appreciated.\nHere is a gnawing and unfaltering human hunger, and the rare\nindividual who honestly satisfies this heart hunger will hold people in the\npalm of his or her hand and ‘even the undertaker will be sorry when he\ndies.’\nThe desire for a feeling of importance is one of the chief distinguishing\ndifferences between mankind and the animals. To illustrate: When I was a\nfarm boy out in Missouri, my father bred fine Duroc-Jersey hogs and\npedigreed white-faced cattle. We used to exhibit our hogs and white-faced\ncattle at the country fairs and livestock shows throughout the Middle West.\nWe won first prizes by the score. My father pinned his blue ribbons on a\nsheet of white muslin, and when friends or visitors came to the house, he\nwould get out the long sheet of muslin. He would hold one end and I would\nhold the other while he exhibited the blue ribbons.\nThe hogs didn’t care about the ribbons they had won. But Father did.\nThese prizes gave him a feeling of importance.\nIf our ancestors hadn’t had this flaming urge for a feeling of\nimportance, civilisation would have been impossible. Without it, we should\nhave been just about like animals.\nIt was this desire for a feeling of importance that led an uneducated,\npoverty-stricken grocery clerk to study some law books he found in the\nbottom of a barrel of household plunder that he had bought for fifty cents.\nYou have probably heard of this grocery clerk. His name was Lincoln.\nIt was this desire for a feeling of importance that inspired Dickens to\nwrite his immortal novels. This desire inspired Sir Christopher Wren to\ndesign his symphonies in stone. This desire made Rockefeller amass\nmillions that he never spent! And this same desire made the richest family\nin your town build a house far too large for its requirements.","This desire makes you want to wear the latest styles, drive the latest\ncars, and talk about your brilliant children.\nIt is this desire that lures many boys and girls into joining gangs and\nengaging in criminal activities. The average young criminal, according to\nE.P. Mulrooney, onetime police commissioner of New York, is filled with\nego, and his first request after arrest is for those lurid newspapers that make\nhim out a hero. The disagreeable prospect of serving time seems remote so\nlong as he can gloat over his likeness sharing space with pictures of sports\nfigures, movie and TV stars and politicians.\nIf you tell me how you get your feeling of importance, I’ll tell you\nwhat you are. That determines your character. That is the most significant\nthing about you. For example, John D. Rockefeller got his feeling of\nimportance by giving money to erect a modern hospital in Peking, China, to\ncare for millions of poor people whom he had never seen and never would\nsee. Dillinger, on the other hand, got his feeling of importance by being a\nbandit, a bank robber and killer. When the FBI agents were hunting him, he\ndashed into a farmhouse up in Minnesota and said, ‘I’m Dillinger!’ He was\nproud of the fact that he was Public Enemy Number One. ‘I’m not going to\nhurt you, but I’m Dillinger!’ he said.\nYes, the one significant difference between Dillinger and Rockefeller\nis how they got their feeling of importance.\nHistory sparkles with amusing examples of famous people struggling\nfor a feeling of importance. Even George Washington wanted to be called\n‘His Mightiness, the President of the United States’; and Columbus pleaded\nfor the title ‘Admiral of the Ocean and Viceroy of India.’ Catherine the\nGreat refused to open letters that were not addressed to ‘Her Imperial\nMajesty’; and Mrs. Lincoln, in the White House, turned upon Mrs. Grant\nlike a tigress and shouted, ‘How dare you be seated in my presence until I\ninvite you!’\nOur millionaires helped finance Admiral Byrd’s expedition to the\nAntarctic in 1928 with the understanding that ranges of icy mountains\nwould be named after them; and Victor Hugo aspired to have nothing less\nthan the city of Paris renamed in his honour. Even Shakespeare, mightiest\nof the mighty, tried to add lustre to his name by procuring a coat of arms for\nhis family.\nPeople sometimes became invalids in order to win sympathy and\nattention, and get a feeling of importance. For example, take Mrs.","McKinley. She got a feeling of importance by forcing her husband, the\nPresident of the United States, to neglect important affairs of state while he\nreclined on the bed beside her for hours at a time, his arm about her,\nsoothing her to sleep. She fed her gnawing desire for attention by insisting\nthat he remain with her while she was having her teeth fixed, and once\ncreated a stormy scene when he had to leave her alone with the dentist\nwhile he kept an appointment with John Hay, his secretary of state.\nThe writer Mary Roberts Rinehart once told me of a bright, vigorous\nyoung woman who became an invalid in order to get a feeling of\nimportance. ‘One day,’ said Mrs. Rinehart, ‘this woman had been obliged to\nface something, her age perhaps. The lonely years were stretching ahead\nand there was little left for her to anticipate.\n‘She took to her bed; and for ten years her old mother travelled to the\nthird floor and back, carrying trays, nursing her. Then one day the old\nmother, weary with service, lay down and died. For some weeks, the invalid\nlanguished; then she got up, put on her clothing, and resumed living again.’\nSome authorities declare that people may actually go insane in order to\nfind, in the dreamland of insanity, the feeling of importance that has been\ndenied them in the harsh world of reality. There are more patients suffering\nfrom mental diseases in the United States than from all other diseases\ncombined.\nWhat is the cause of insanity?\nNobody can answer such a sweeping question, but we know that\ncertain diseases, such as syphilis, break down and destroy the brain cells\nand result in insanity. In fact, about one-half of all mental diseases can be\nattributed to such physical causes as brain lesions, alcohol, toxins and\ninjuries. But the other half – and this is the appalling part of the story – the\nother half of the people who go insane apparently have nothing organically\nwrong with their brain cells. In post-mortem examinations, when their brain\ntissues are studied under the highest-powered microscopes, these tissues are\nfound to be apparently just as healthy as yours and mine.\nWhy do these people go insane?\nI put that question to the head physician of one of our most important\npsychiatric hospitals. This doctor, who has received the highest honours and\nthe most coveted awards for his knowledge of this subject, told me frankly\nthat he didn’t know why people went insane. Nobody knows for sure. But\nhe did say that many people who go insane find in insanity a feeling of","importance that they were unable to achieve in the world of reality. Then he\ntold me this story:\n‘I have a patient right now whose marriage proved to be a tragedy. She\nwanted love, sexual gratification, children and social prestige, but life\nblasted all her hopes. Her husband didn’t love her. He refused even to eat\nwith her and forced her to serve his meals in his room upstairs. She had no\nchildren, no social standing. She went insane; and, in her imagination, she\ndivorced her husband and resumed her maiden name. She now believes she\nhas married into English aristocracy, and she insists on being called Lady\nSmith.\n‘And as for children, she imagines now that she has had a new child\nevery night. Each time I call on her she says: “Doctor, I had a baby last\nnight.” ’\nLife once wrecked all her dream ships on the sharp rocks of reality; but\nin the sunny, fantasy isles of insanity, all her barkentines race into port with\ncanvas billowing and winds winging through the masts.\nTragic? Oh, I don’t know. Her physician said to me: ‘If I could stretch\nout my hand and restore her sanity, I wouldn’t do it. She’s much happier as\nshe is.’\nIf some people are so hungry for a feeling of importance that they\nactually go insane to get it, imagine what miracle you and I can achieve by\ngiving people honest appreciation this side of insanity.\nOne of the first people in American business to be paid a salary of over\na million dollars a year (when there was no income tax and a person earning\nfifty dollars a week was considered well off) was Charles Schwab. He had\nbeen picked by Andrew Carnegie to become the first president of the newly\nformed United States Steel Company in 1921, when Schwab was only\nthirty-eight years old. (Schwab later left U.S. Steel to take over the then-\ntroubled Bethlehem Steel Company, and he rebuilt it into one of the most\nprofitable companies in America.)\nWhy did Andrew Carnegie pay a million dollars a year, or more than\nthree thousand dollars a day, to Charles Schwab? Why? Because Schwab\nwas a genius? No. Because he knew more about the manufacture of steel\nthan other people? Nonsense. Charles Schwab told me himself that he had\nmany men working for him who knew more about the manufacture of steel\nthan he did.","Schwab says that he was paid this salary largely because of his ability\nto deal with people. I asked him how he did it. Here is his secret set down in\nhis own words – words that ought to be cast in eternal bronze and hung in\nevery home and school, every shop and office in the land – words that\nchildren ought to memorise instead of wasting their time memorising the\nconjugation of Latin verbs or the amount of the annual rainfall in Brazil –\nwords that will all but transform your life and mine if we will only live\nthem:\n‘I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people,’ said\nSchwab, ‘the greatest asset I possess, and the way to develop the best that is\nin a person is by appreciation and encouragement.\n‘There is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a person as\ncriticisms from superiors. I never criticise anyone. I believe in giving a\nperson incentive to work. So I am anxious to praise but loath to find fault. If\nI like anything, I am hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise.’\nThat is what Schwab did. But what do average people do? The exact\nopposite. If they don’t like a thing, they bawl out their subordinates; if they\ndo like it, they say nothing. As the old couplet says: ‘Once I did bad and\nthat I heard ever/Twice I did good, but that I heard never.’\n‘In my wide association in life, meeting with many and great people in\nvarious parts of the world,’ Schwab declared, ‘I have yet to find the person,\nhowever great or exalted his station, who did not do better work and put\nforth greater effort under a spirit of approval than he would ever do under a\nspirit of criticism.’\nThat he said, frankly, was one of the outstanding reasons for the\nphenomenal success of Andrew Carnegie. Carnegie praised his associates\npublicly as well as privately.\nCarnegie wanted to praise his assistants even on his tombstone. He\nwrote an epitaph for himself which read: ‘Here lies one who knew how to\nget around him men who were cleverer than himself.’\nSincere appreciation was one of the secrets of the first John D.\nRockefeller’s success in handling men. For example, when one of his\npartners, Edward T. Bedford, lost a million dollars for the firm by a bad buy\nin South America, John D. might have criticised; but he knew Bedford had\ndone his best – and the incident was closed. So Rockefeller found\nsomething to praise; he congratulated Bedford because he had been able to","save 60 percent of the money he had invested. ‘That’s splendid,’ said\nRockefeller. ‘We don’t always do as well as that upstairs.’\nI have among my clippings a story that I know never happened, but it\nillustrates a truth, so I’ll repeat it:\nAccording to this silly story, a farm woman, at the end of a heavy\nday’s work, set before her menfolks a heaping pile of hay. And when they\nindignantly demanded whether she had gone crazy, she replied: ‘Why, how\ndid I know you’d notice? I’ve been cooking for you men for the last twenty\nyears and in all that time I ain’t heard no word to let me know you wasn’t\njust eating hay.’\nWhen a study was made a few years ago on runaway wives, what do\nyou think was discovered to be the main reason wives ran away? It was\n‘lack of appreciation.’ And I’d bet that a similar study made of runaway\nhusbands would come out the same way. We often take our spouses so\nmuch for granted that we never let them know we appreciate them.\nA member of one of our classes told of a request made by his wife.\nShe and a group of other women in her church were involved in a self-\nimprovement programme. She asked her husband to help her by listing six\nthings he believed she could do to help her become a better wife. He\nreported to the class: ‘I was surprised by such a request. Frankly, it would\nhave been easy for me to list six things I would like to change about her –\nmy heavens, she could have listed a thousand things she would like to\nchange about me – but I didn’t. I said to her, “Let me think about it and give\nyou an answer in the morning.”\n‘The next morning I got up very early and called the florist and had\nthem send six red roses to my wife with a note saying: ‘I can’t think of six\nthings I would like to change about you. I love you the way you are.’\n‘When I arrived at home that evening, who do you think greeted me at\nthe door: That’s right. My wife! She was almost in tears. Needless to say, I\nwas extremely glad I had not criticised her as she had requested.\n‘The following Sunday at church, after she had reported the results of\nher assignment, several women with whom she had been studying came up\nto me and said, “That was the most considerate thing I have ever heard.” It\nwas then I realised the power of appreciation.’\nFlorenz Ziegfeld, the most spectacular producer who ever dazzled\nBroadway, gained his reputation by his subtle ability to ‘glorify the\nAmerican girl.’ Time after time, he took drab little creatures that no one","ever looked at twice and transformed them on the stage into glamorous\nvisions of mystery and seduction. Knowing the value of appreciation and\nconfidence, he made women feel beautiful by the sheer power of his\ngallantry and consideration. He was practical: he raised the salary of chorus\ngirls from thirty dollars a week to as high as one hundred and seventy-five.\nAnd he was also chivalrous; on opening night at the Follies, he sent\ntelegrams to the stars in the cast, and he deluged every chorus girl in the\nshow with American Beauty roses.\nI once succumbed to the fad of fasting and went for six days and nights\nwithout eating. It wasn’t difficult. I was less hungry at the end of the sixth\nday than I was at the end of the second. Yet I know, as you know, people\nwho would think they had committed a crime if they let their families or\nemployees go for six days without food; but they will let them go for six\ndays, and six weeks, and sometimes sixty years without giving them the\nhearty appreciation that they crave almost as much as they crave food.\nWhen Alfred Lunt, one of the great actors of his time, played the\nleading role in Reunion in Vienna, he said, ‘There is nothing I need so much\nas nourishment for my self-esteem.’\nWe nourish the bodies of our children and friends and employees, but\nhow seldom do we nourish their self-esteem? We provide them with roast\nbeef and potatoes to build energy, but we neglect to give them kind words\nof appreciation that would sing in their memories for years like the music of\nthe morning stars.\nPaul Harvey, in one of his radio broadcasts, ‘The Rest of the Story,’\ntold how showing sincere appreciation can change a person’s life. He\nreported that years ago a teacher in Detroit asked Stevie Morris to help her\nfind a mouse that was lost in the classroom. You see, she appreciated the\nfact that nature had given Stevie something no one else in the room had.\nNature had given Stevie a remarkable pair of ears to compensate for his\nblind eyes. But this was really the first time Stevie had been shown\nappreciation for those talented ears. Now, years later, he says that this act of\nappreciation was the beginning of a new life. You see, from that time on he\ndeveloped his gift of hearing and went on to become, under the stage name\nof Stevie Wonder, one of the great pop singers and songwriters of the\nseventies.\n1\nSome readers are saying right now as they read these lines: ‘Oh,\nphooey! Flattery! Bear oil! I’ve tried that stuff. It doesn’t work – not with","intelligent people.’\nOf course flattery seldom works with discerning people. It is shallow,\nselfish and insincere. It ought to fail and it usually does. True, some people\nare so hungry, so thirsty, for appreciation that they will swallow anything,\njust as a starving man will eat grass and fishworms.\nEven Queen Victoria was susceptible to flattery. Prime Minister\nBenjamin Disraeli confessed that he put it on thick in dealing with the\nQueen. To use his exact words, he said he ‘spread it on with a trowel.’ But\nDisraeli was one of the most polished, deft and adroit men who ever ruled\nthe far-flung British Empire. He was a genius in his line. What would work\nfor him wouldn’t necessarily work for you and me. In the long run, flattery\nwill do you more harm than good. Flattery is counterfeit, and like\ncounterfeit money, it will eventually get you into trouble if you pass it to\nsomeone else.\nThe difference between appreciation and flattery? That is simple. One\nis sincere and the other insincere. One comes from the heart out; the other\nfrom the teeth out. One is unselfish; the other selfish. One is universally\nadmired; the other universally condemned.\nI recently saw a bust of Mexican hero General Alvaro Obregon in the\nChapultepec palace in Mexico City. Below the bust are carved these wise\nwords from General Obregon’s philosophy: ‘Don’t be afraid of enemies\nwho attack you. Be afraid of the friends who flatter you.’\nNo! No! No! I am not suggesting flattery! Far from it. I’m talking\nabout a new way of life. Let me repeat. I am talking about a new way of\nlife.\nKing George V had a set of six maxims displayed on the walls of his\nstudy at Buckingham Palace. One of these maxims said: ‘Teach me neither\nto proffer nor receive cheap praise.’ That’s all flattery is – cheap praise. I\nonce read a definition of flattery that may be worth repeating: ‘Flattery is\ntelling the other person precisely what he thinks about himself.’\n‘Use what language you will,’ said Ralph Waldo Emerson, ‘you can\nnever say anything but what you are.’\nIf all we had to do was flatter, everybody would catch on and we\nshould all be experts in human relations.\nWhen we are not engaged in thinking about some definite problem, we\nusually spend about 95 percent of our time thinking about ourselves. Now,\nif we stop thinking about ourselves for a while and begin to think of the","other person’s good points, we won’t have to resort to flattery so cheap and\nfalse that it can be spotted almost before it is out of the mouth.\nOne of the most neglected virtues of our daily existence is\nappreciation. Somehow, we neglect to praise our son or daughter when he\nor she brings home a good report card, and we fail to encourage our\nchildren when they first succeed in baking a cake or building a birdhouse.\nNothing pleases children more than this kind of parental interest and\napproval.\nThe next time you enjoy filet mignon at the club, send word to the chef\nthat it was excellently prepared, and when a tired salesperson shows you\nunusual courtesy, please mention it.\nEvery minister, lecturer and public speaker knows the discouragement\nof pouring himself or herself out to an audience and not receiving a single\nripple of appreciative comment. What applies to professionals applies\ndoubly to workers in offices, shops and factories and our families and\nfriends. In our interpersonal relations we should never forget that all our\nassociates are human beings and hunger for appreciation. It is the legal\ntender that all souls enjoy.\nTry leaving a friendly trail of little sparks of gratitude on your daily\ntrips. You will be surprised how they will set small flames of friendship that\nwill be rose beacons on your next visit.\nPamela Dunham of New Fairfield, Connecticut, had among her\nresponsibilities on her job the supervision of a janitor who was doing a very\npoor job. The other employees would jeer at him and litter the hallways to\nshow him what a bad job he was doing. It was so bad, productive time was\nbeing lost in the shop.\nWithout success, Pam tried various ways to motivate this person. She\nnoticed that occasionally he did a particularly good piece of work. She\nmade a point to praise him for it in front of the other people. Each day the\njob he did all around got better, and pretty soon he started doing all his\nwork efficiently. Now he does an excellent job and other people give him\nappreciation and recognition. Honest appreciation got results where\ncriticism and ridicule failed.\nHurting people not only does not change them, it is never called for.\nThere is an old saying that I have cut out and pasted on my mirror where I\ncannot help but see it every day:","I shall pass this way but once; any good, therefore, that I can\ndo or any kindness that I can show to any human being, let\nme do it now. Let me not defer nor neglect it, for I shall not\npass this way again.\nEmerson said: ‘Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that,\nI learn of him.’\nIf that was true of Emerson, isn’t it likely to be a thousand times more\ntrue of you and me? Let’s cease thinking of our accomplishments, our\nwants. Let’s try to figure out the other person’s good points. Then forget\nflattery. Give honest, sincere appreciation. Be ‘hearty in your approbation\nand lavish in your praise,’ and people will cherish your words and treasure\nthem and repeat them over a lifetime – repeat them years after you have\nforgotten them.\nPRINCIPLE 2\nGive honest and sincere appreciation.\n1. Paul Aurandt, Paul Harvey’s The Rest of the Story (New York: Doubleday, 1977). Edited and\ncompiled by Lynne Harvey. Copyright © by Paulynne, Inc.","I OFTEN WENT fishing up in Maine during the summer. Personally I am very\nfond of strawberries and cream, but I have found that for some strange\nreason, fish prefer worms. So when I went fishing, I didn’t think about what\nI wanted. I didn’t bait the hook with strawberries and cream. Rather, I\ndangled a worm or a grasshopper in front of the fish and said: ‘Wouldn’t\nyou like to have that?’\nWhy not use the same common sense when fishing for people?\nThat is what Lloyd George, Great Britain’s Prime Minister during\nWorld War I, did. When someone asked him how he managed to stay in\npower after the other wartime leaders – Wilson, Orlando and Clemenceau –\nhad been forgotten, he replied that if his staying on top might be attributed\nto any one thing, it would be to his having learned that it was necessary to\nbait the hook to suit the fish.\nWhy talk about what we want? That is childish. Absurd. Of course,\nyou are interested in what you want. You are eternally interested in it. But\nno one else is. The rest of us are just like you: we are interested in what we\nwant.\nSo the only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about\nwhat they want and show them how to get it.\nRemember that tomorrow when you are trying to get somebody to do\nsomething. If, for example, you don’t want your children to smoke, don’t\npreach at them, and don’t talk about what you want; but show them that\ncigarettes may keep them from making the basketball team or winning the\nhundred-yard dash.\nThis is a good thing to remember regardless of whether you are\ndealing with children or calves or chimpanzees. For example: one day\nRalph Waldo Emerson and his son tried to get a calf into the barn. But they\nmade the common mistake of thinking only of what they wanted: Emerson","pushed and his son pulled. But the calf was doing just what they were\ndoing: he was thinking only of what he wanted; so he stiffened his legs and\nstubbornly refused to leave the pasture. The Irish housemaid saw their\npredicament. She couldn’t write essays and books; but, on this occasion at\nleast, she had more horse sense, or calf sense, than Emerson had. She\nthought of what the calf wanted; so she put her maternal finger in the calf’s\nmouth and let the calf suck her finger as she gently led him into the barn.\nEvery act you have ever performed since the day you were born was\nperformed because you wanted something. How about the time you gave a\nlarge contribution to the Red Cross? Yes, that is no exception to the rule.\nYou gave the Red Cross the donation because you wanted to lend a helping\nhand; you wanted to do a beautiful, unselfish, divine act. ‘In as much as ye\nhave done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto\nme.’\nIf you hadn’t wanted that feeling more than you wanted your money,\nyou would not have made the contribution. Of course, you might have made\nthe contribution because you were ashamed to refuse or because a customer\nasked you to do it. But one thing is certain. You made the contribution\nbecause you wanted something.\nHarry A. Overstreet in his illuminating book Influencing Human\nBehaviour said: ‘Action springs out of what we fundamentally desire . . .\nand the best piece of advice which can be given to would-be persuaders,\nwhether in business, in the home, in the school, in politics, is: First, arouse\nin the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world\nwith him. He who cannot walks a lonely way.’\nAndrew Carnegie, the poverty-stricken Scotch lad who started to work\nat two cents an hour and finally gave away $365 million, learned early in\nlife that the only way to influence people is to talk in terms of what the\nother person wants. He attended school only four years; yet he learned how\nto handle people.\nTo illustrate: His sister-in-law was worried sick over her two boys.\nThey were at Yale, and they were so busy with their own affairs that they\nneglected to write home and paid no attention whatever to their mother’s\nfrantic letters.\nThen Carnegie offered to wager a hundred dollars that he could get an\nanswer by return mail, without even asking for it. Someone called his bet;","so he wrote his nephews a chatty letter, mentioning casually in a postscript\nthat he was sending each one a five-dollar bill.\nHe neglected, however, to enclose the money.\nBack came replies by return mail thanking ‘Dear Uncle Andrew’ for\nhis kind note and – you can finish the sentence yourself.\nAnother example of persuading comes from Stan Novak of Cleveland,\nOhio, a participant in our course. Stan came home from work one evening\nto find his youngest son, Tim, kicking and screaming on the living room\nfloor. He was to start kindergarten the next day and was protesting that he\nwould not go. Stan’s normal reaction would have been to banish the child to\nhis room and tell him he’d better make up his mind to go. He had no choice.\nBut tonight, recognising that this would not really help Tim start\nkindergarten in the best frame of mind, Stan sat down and thought, ‘If I\nwere Tim, why would I be excited about going to kindergarten?’ He and his\nwife made a list of all the fun things Tim would do such as finger painting,\nsinging songs, making new friends. Then they put them into action. ‘We all\nstarted finger-painting on the kitchen table – my wife, Lil, my other son\nBob, and myself, all having fun. Soon Tim was peeping around the corner.\nNext he was begging to participate. “Oh, no! You have to go to kindergarten\nfirst to learn how to fingerpaint.” With all the enthusiasm I could muster I\nwent through the list talking in terms he could understand – telling him all\nthe fun he would have in kindergarten. The next morning, I thought I was\nthe first one up. I went downstairs and found Tim sitting sound asleep in the\nliving room chair.\n“What are you doing here?” I asked. “I’m waiting to go to\nkindergarten. I don’t want to be late.” The enthusiasm of our entire family\nhad aroused in Tim an eager want that no amount of discussion or threat\ncould have possibly accomplished.’\nTomorrow you may want to persuade somebody to do something.\nBefore you speak, pause and ask yourself: ‘How can I make this person\nwant to do it?’\nThat question will stop us from rushing into a situation heedlessly,\nwith futile chatter about our desires.\nAt one time I rented the grand ballroom of a certain New York hotel\nfor twenty nights in each season in order to hold a series of lectures.\nAt the beginning of one season, I was suddenly informed that I should\nhave to pay almost three times as much rent as formerly. This news reached","me after the tickets had been printed and distributed and all the\nannouncements had been made.\nNaturally, I didn’t want to pay the increase, but what was the use of\ntalking to the hotel about what I wanted? They were only interested in what\nthey wanted. So a couple of days later I went to see the manager.\n‘I was a bit shocked when I got your letter,’ I said, ‘but I don’t blame\nyou at all. If I had been in your position, I should probably have written a\nsimilar letter myself. Your duty as the manager of the hotel is to make all\nthe profit possible. If you don’t do that you will be fired and you ought to\nbe fired. Now, let’s take a piece of paper and write down the advantages and\nthe disadvantages that will accrue to you, if you insist on this increase in\nrent.’\nThen I took a letterhead and ran a line through the centre and headed\none column ‘Advantages’ and the other column ‘Disadvantages.’\nI wrote down under the head ‘Advantages’ these words: ‘Ballroom\nfree.’ Then I went on to say: ‘You will have the advantage of having the\nballroom free to rent for dances and conventions. That is a big advantage,\nfor affairs like that will pay you much more than you can get for a series of\nlectures. If I tie your ballroom up for twenty nights during the course of the\nseason, it is sure to mean a loss of some very profitable business to you.\n‘Now, let’s consider the disadvantages. First, instead of increasing\nyour income from me, you are going to decrease it. In fact, you are going to\nwipe it out because I cannot pay the rent you are asking. I shall be forced to\nhold these lectures at some other place.\n‘There’s another disadvantage to you also. These lectures attract\ncrowds of educated and cultured people to your hotel. That is good\nadvertising for you, isn’t it? In fact, if you spent five thousand dollars\nadvertising in the newspapers, you couldn’t bring as many people to look at\nyour hotel as I can bring by these lectures. That is worth a lot to a hotel,\nisn’t it?’\nAs I talked, I wrote these two ‘disadvantages’ under the proper\nheading, and handed the sheet of paper to the manager, saying: ‘I wish you\nwould carefully consider both the advantages and disadvantages that are\ngoing to accrue to you and then give me your final decision.’\nI received a letter the next day, informing me that my rent would be\nincreased only 50 percent instead of 300 percent.","Mind you, I got this reduction without saying a word about what I\nwanted. I talked all the time about what the other person wanted and how he\ncould get it.\nSuppose I had done the human, natural thing; suppose I had stormed\ninto his office and said, ‘What do you mean by raising my rent three\nhundred percent when you know the tickets have been printed and the\nannouncements made? Three hundred percent! Ridiculous! Absurd! I won’t\npay it!’\nWhat would have happened then? An argument would have begun to\nsteam and boil and sputter – and you know how arguments end. Even if I\nhad convinced him that he was wrong, his pride would have made it\ndifficult for him to back down and give in.\nHere is one of the best bits of advice ever given about the fine art of\nhuman relationships. ‘If there is any one secret of success,’ said Henry\nFord, ‘it lies in the ability to get the other person’s point of view and see\nthings from that person’s angle as well as from your own.’\nThat is so good, I want to repeat it: ‘If there is any one secret of\nsuccess, it lies in the ability to get the other person’s point of view and see\nthings from that person’s angle as well as from your own.’\nThat is so simple, so obvious, that anyone ought to see the truth of it at\na glance; yet 90 percent of the people on this earth ignore it 90 percent of\nthe time.\nAn example? Look at the letters that come across your desk tomorrow\nmorning, and you will find that most of them violate this important canon\nof common sense. Take this one, a letter written by the head of the radio\ndepartment of an advertising agency with offices scattered across the\ncontinent. This letter was sent to the managers of local radio stations\nthroughout the country. (I have set down, in brackets, my reactions to each\nparagraph.)\nMr. John Blank,\nBlankville,\nIndiana\nDear Mr. Blank:\nThe – company desires to retain its position in advertising\nagency leadership in the radio field.","[Who cares about your company desires? I am worried about my own\nproblems. The bank is foreclosing the mortgage on my house, the bugs are\ndestroying the hollyhocks, the stock market tumbled yesterday. I missed the\neight-fifteen this morning. I wasn’t invited to the Jones’s dance last night,\nthe doctor tells me I have high blood pressure and neuritis and dandruff.\nAnd then what happens? I come down to the office this morning worried,\nopen my mail and here is some little whippersnapper off in New York\nyapping about what his company wants. Bah! If he only realised what sort\nof impression his letter makes, he would get out of the advertising business\nand start manufacturing sheep dip.]\nThis agency’s national advertising accounts were the\nbulwark of the network. Our subsequent clearances of station\ntime have kept us at the top of agencies year after year.\n[You are big and rich and right at the top, are you? So what? I don’t give\ntwo whoops in Hades if you are as big as General Motors and General\nElectric and the General Staff of the U.S. Army all combined. If you had as\nmuch sense as a half-witted hummingbird, you would realise that I am\ninterested in how big I am – not how big you are. All this talk about your\nenormous success makes me feel small and unimportant.]\nWe desire to service our accounts with the last word on\nradio station information.\n[You desire! You desire. You unmitigated ass. I’m not interested in what\nyou desire or what the President of the United States desires. Let me tell\nyou once and for all that I am interested in what I desire – and you haven’t\nsaid a word about that yet in this absurd letter of yours.]\nWill you, therefore, put the – company on your preferred\nlist for weekly station information – every single detail that will\nbe useful to an agency in intelligently booking time.\n[‘Preferred list.’ You have your nerve! You make me feel insignificant by\nyour big talk about your company – and then you ask me to put you on a\n‘preferred’ list, and you don’t even say ‘please’ when you ask it.]","A prompt acknowledgement of this letter, giving us your\nlatest ‘doings’ will be mutually helpful.\n[You fool! you mail me a cheap form letter – a letter scattered far and wide\nlike the autumn leaves – and you have the gall to ask me, when I am\nworried about the mortgage and the hollyhocks and my blood pressure, to\nsit down and dictate a personal note acknowledging your form letter – and\nyou ask me to do it ‘promptly.’ What do you mean, ‘promptly’? Don’t you\nknow I am just as busy as you are – or, at least, I like to think I am. And\nwhile we are on the subject, who gave you the lordly right to order me\naround? . . . You say it will be ‘mutually helpful.’ At last, at last, you have\nbegun to see my viewpoint. But you are vague about how it will be to my\nadvantage.]\nVery truly yours,\nJohn Doe\nManager Radio Department\nP.S. The enclosed reprint from the Blankville Journal will\nbe of interest to you, and you may want to broadcast it over your\nstation.\n[Finally, down here in the postscript, you mention something that may help\nme solve one of my problems. Why didn’t you begin your letter with – but\nwhat’s the use? Any advertising man who is guilty of perpetrating such\ndrivel as you have sent me has something wrong with his medulla\noblongata. You don’t need a letter giving our latest doings. What you need\nis a quart of iodine in your thyroid gland.]\nNow, if people who devote their lives to advertising and who pose as\nexperts in the art of influencing people to buy – if they write a letter like\nthat, what can we expect from the butcher and baker or the auto mechanic?\nHere is another letter, written by the superintendent of a large freight\nterminal to a student of this course, Edward Vermylen. What effect did this\nletter have on the man to whom it was addressed? Read it and then I’ll tell\nyou.\nA. Zerega’s Sons, Inc.\n28 Front St.\nBrooklyn, N.Y. 11201","Attention: Mr. Edward Vermylen\nGentlemen:\nThe operations at our outbound-rail-receiving station are\nhandicapped because a material percentage of the total\nbusiness is delivered us in the late afternoon. This condition\nresults in congestion, overtime on the part of our forces,\ndelays to trucks, and in some cases delays to freight. On\nNovember 10, we received from your company a lot of 510\npieces, which reached here at 4.20. P.M.\nWe solicit your cooperation toward overcoming the\nundesirable effects arising from late receipt of freight. May\nwe ask that, on days on which you ship the volume which was\nreceived on the above date, effort be made either to get the\ntruck here earlier or to deliver us part of the freight during\nthe morning?\nThe advantage that would accrue to you under such an\narrangement would be that of more expeditious discharge of\nyour trucks and the assurance that your business would go\nforward on the date of its receipt.\nVery truly yours,\nJ – B – , Supt.\nAfter reading this letter, Mr. Vermylen, sales manager for A. Zerega’s Sons,\nInc., sent it to me with the following comment:\nThis letter had the reverse effect from that which was\nintended. The letter begins by describing the Terminal’s\ndifficulties, in which we are not interested, generally speaking.\nOur cooperation is then requested without any thought as to\nwhether it would inconvenience us, and then finally, in the last\nparagraph, the fact is mentioned that if we do cooperate it\nwill mean more expeditious discharge of our trucks with the\nassurance that our freight will go forward on the date of its\nreceipt.\nIn other words, that in which we are most interested is\nmentioned last, and the whole effect is one of raising a spirit\nof antagonism rather than of cooperation.","Let’s see if we can’t rewrite and improve this letter. Let’s not waste any\ntime talking about our problems. As Henry Ford admonishes, let’s ‘get the\nother person’s point of view and see things from his or her angle, as well as\nfrom our own.’ Here is one way of revising the letter. It may not be the best\nway, but isn’t it an improvement?\nMr. Edward Vermylen\nc/o A Zerega’s Sons, Inc.\n28 Front St.\nBrooklyn, N.Y. 11201\nDear Mr. Vermylen:\nYour company has been one of our good customers for\nfourteen years. Naturally, we are very grateful for your\npatronage and are eager to give you the speedy, efficient\nservice you deserve. However, we regret to say that it isn’t\npossible for us to do that when your trucks bring us a large\nshipment late in the afternoon, as they did on November 10.\nWhy? Because many other customers make late afternoon\ndeliveries also. Naturally, that causes congestion. That means\nyour trucks are held up unavoidably at the pier and\nsometimes even your freight is delayed.\nThat’s bad, but it can be avoided. If you make your\ndeliveries at the pier in the morning when possible, your\ntrucks will be able to keep moving, your freight will get\nimmediate attention, and our workers will get home early at\nnight to enjoy a dinner of the delicious macaroni and noodles\nthat you manufacture.\nRegardless of when your shipments arrive, we shall\nalways cheerfully do all in our power to serve you promptly.\nYou are busy. Please don’t trouble to answer this note.\nYours truly,\nJ – B – , Supt.\nBarbara Anderson, who worked in a bank in New York, desired to move to\nPhoenix, Arizona, because of the health of her son. Using the principles she\nhad learned in our course, she wrote the following letter to twelve banks in\nPhoenix:","Dear Sir:\nMy ten years of bank experience should be of interest to\na rapidly growing bank like yours.\nIn various capacities in bank operations with the\nBankers Trust Company in New York, leading to my present\nassignment as Branch Manager, I have acquired skills in all\nphases of banking including depositor relations, credits, loans\nand administration.\nI will be relocating to Phoenix in May and I am sure I\ncan contribute to your growth and profit. I will be in Phoenix\nthe week of April 3 and would appreciate the opportunity to\nshow you how I can help your bank meet its goals.\nSincerely,\nBarbara L. Anderson\nDo you think Mrs. Anderson received any response from that letter? Eleven\nof the twelve banks invited her to be interviewed, and she had a choice of\nwhich bank’s offer to accept. Why? Mrs. Anderson did not state what she\nwanted, but wrote in the letter how she could help them, and focused on\ntheir wants, not her own.\nThousands of salespeople are pounding the pavements today, tired,\ndiscouraged and underpaid. Why? Because they are always thinking only of\nwhat they want. They don’t realise that neither you nor I want to buy\nanything. If we did, we would go out and buy it. But both of us are eternally\ninterested in solving our problems. And if salespeople can show us how\ntheir services or merchandise will help us solve our problems, they won’t\nneed to sell us. We’ll buy. And customers like to feel that they are buying –\nnot being sold.\nYet many salespeople spend a lifetime in selling without seeing things\nfrom the customer’s angle. For example, for many years I lived in Forest\nHills, a little community of private homes in the centre of Greater New\nYork. One day as I was rushing to the station, I chanced to meet a real-\nestate operator who had bought and sold property in that area for many\nyears. He knew Forest Hills well, so I hurriedly asked him whether or not\nmy stucco house was built with metal lath or hollow tile. He said he didn’t\nknow and told me what I already knew – that I could find out by calling the\nForest Hills Garden Association. The following morning, I received a letter","from him. Did he give me the information I wanted? He could have gotten\nit in sixty seconds by a telephone call. But he didn’t. He told me again that I\ncould get it by telephoning, and then asked me to let him handle my\ninsurance.\nHe was not interested in helping me. He was interested only in helping\nhimself.\nJ. Howard Lucas of Birmingham, Alabama, tells how two salespeople\nfrom the same company handled the same type of situation. He reported:\n‘Several years ago I was on the management team of a small company.\nHeadquartered near us was the district office of a large insurance company.\nTheir agents were assigned territories, and our company was assigned to\ntwo agents, whom I shall refer to as Carl and John.\n‘One morning, Carl dropped by our office and casually mentioned that\nhis company had just introduced a new life insurance policy for executives\nand thought we might be interested later on and he would get back to us\nwhen he had more information on it.\n‘The same day, John saw us on the sidewalk while returning from a\ncoffee break, and he shouted: “Hey Luke, hold up, I have some great news\nfor you fellows.” He hurried over and very excitedly told us about an\nexecutive life insurance policy his company had introduced that very day.\n(It was the same policy that Carl had casually mentioned.) He wanted us to\nhave one of the first issued. He gave us a few important facts about the\ncoverage and ended saying, “The policy is so new, I’m going to have\nsomeone from the home office come out tomorrow and explain it. Now, in\nthe meantime, let’s get the applications signed and on the way so he can\nhave more information to work with.” His enthusiasm aroused in us an\neager want for this policy even though we still did not have details. When\nthey were made available to us, they confirmed John’s initial understanding\nof the policy, and he not only sold each of us a policy but later doubled our\ncoverage.\n‘Carl could have had those sales, but he made no effort to arouse in us\nany desire for the policies.’\nThe world is full of people who are grabbing and self-seeking. So the\nrare individual who unselfishly tries to serve others has an enormous\nadvantage. He has little competition. Owen D. Young, a noted lawyer and\none of America’s great business leaders, once said: ‘People who can put\nthemselves in the place of other people, who can understand the workings","of their minds, need never worry about what the future has in store for\nthem.’\nIf out of reading this book you get just one thing – an increased\ntendency to think always in terms of other people’s point of view, and see\nthings from their angle – if you get that one thing out of this book, it may\neasily prove to be one of the building blocks of your career.\nLooking at the other person’s point of view and arousing in him an\neager want for something is not to be construed as manipulating that person\nso that he will do something that is only for your benefit and his detriment.\nEach party should gain from the negotiation. In the letters to Mr. Vermylen,\nboth the sender and the receiver of the correspondence gained by\nimplementing what was suggested. Both the bank and Mrs. Anderson won\nby her letter in that the bank obtained a valuable employee and Mrs.\nAnderson a suitable job. And in the example of John’s sale of insurance to\nMr. Lucas, both gained through this transaction.\nAnother example in which everybody gains through this principle of\narousing an eager want comes from Michael E. Whidden of Warwick,\nRhode Island, who is a territory salesman for the Shell Oil Company. Mike\nwanted to become the Number One salesperson in his district, but one\nservice station was holding him back. It was run by an older man who could\nnot be motivated to clean up his station. It was in such poor shape that sales\nwere declining significantly.\nThis manager would not listen to any of Mike’s pleas to upgrade the\nstation. After many exhortations and heart-to-heart talks – all of which had\nno impact – Mike decided to invite the manager to visit the newest Shell\nstation in his territory.\nThe manager was so impressed by the facilities at the new station that\nwhen Mike visited him the next time, his station was cleaned up and had\nrecorded a sales increase. This enabled Mike to reach the Number One spot\nin his district. All his talking and discussion hadn’t helped, but by arousing\nan eager want in the manager, by showing him the modern station, he had\naccomplished his goal, and both the manager and Mike benefited.\nMost people go through college and learn to read Virgil and master the\nmysteries of calculus without ever discovering how their own minds\nfunction. For instance: I once gave a course in Effective Speaking for the\nyoung college graduates who were entering the employ of the Carrier\nCorporation, the large air-conditioner manufacturer. One of the participants","wanted to persuade the others to play basketball in their free time, and this\nis about what he said: ‘I want you to come out and play basketball. I like to\nplay basketball, but the last few times I’ve been to the gymnasium there\nhaven’t been enough people to get up a game. Two or three of us got by\nthrowing the ball around the other night – and I got a black eye. I wish all\nof you would come down tomorrow night. I want to play basketball.’\nDid he talk about anything you want? You don’t want to go to a\ngymnasium that no one else goes to, do you? You don’t care about what he\nwants. You don’t want to get a black eye.\nCould he have shown you how to get the things you want by using the\ngymnasium? Surely. More pep. Keener edge to the appetite. Clearer brain.\nFun. Games. Basketball.\nTo repeat Professor Overstreet’s wise advice: First, arouse in the other\nperson an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world with him.\nHe who cannot walks a lonely way.\nOne of the students in the author’s training course was worried about\nhis little boy. The child was underweight and refused to eat properly. His\nparents used the usual method. They scolded and nagged. ‘Mother wants\nyou to eat this and that.’ ‘Father wants you to grow up to be a big man.’\nDid the boy pay any attention to these pleas? Just about as much as\nyou pay to one fleck of sand on a sandy beach.\nNo one with a trace of horse sense would expect a child three years old\nto react to the viewpoint of a father thirty years old. Yet that was precisely\nwhat that father had expected. It was absurd. He finally saw that. So he said\nto himself: ‘What does that boy want? How can I tie up what I want to what\nhe wants?’\nIt was easy for the father when he started thinking about it. His boy\nhad a tricycle that he loved to ride up and down the sidewalk in front of the\nhouse in Broolkyn. A few doors down the street lived a bully – a bigger boy\nwho would pull the little boy off his tricycle and ride it himself.\nNaturally, the little boy would run screaming to his mother, and she\nwould have to come out and take the bully off the tricycle and put her little\nboy on again. This happened almost every day.\nWhat did the little boy want? It didn’t take a Sherlock Holmes to\nanswer that one. His pride, his anger, his desire for a feeling of importance\n– all the strongest emotions in his makeup – goaded him to get revenge, to\nsmash the bully in the nose. And when his father explained that the boy","would be able to wallop the daylights out of the bigger kid someday if he\nwould only eat the things his mother wanted him to eat – when his father\npromised him that – there was no longer any problem of dietetics. That boy\nwould have eaten spinach, sauerkraut, salt mackerel – anything in order to\nbe big enough to whip the bully who had humiliated him so often.\nAfter solving that problem, the parents tackled another: the little boy\nhad the unholy habit of wetting his bed.\nHe slept with his grandmother. In the morning, his grandmother would\nwake up and feel the sheet and say: ‘Look, Johnny, what you did again last\nnight.’\nHe would say: ‘No, I didn’t do it. You did it.’\nScolding, spanking, shaming him, reiterating that the parents didn’t\nwant him to do it – none of these things kept the bed dry. So the parents\nasked: ‘How can we make this boy want to stop wetting his bed?’\nWhat were his wants? First, he wanted to wear pyjamas like Daddy\ninstead of wearing a nightgown like Grandmother. Grandmother was\ngetting fed up with his nocturnal iniquities, so she gladly offered to buy him\na pair of pyjamas if he would reform. Second, he wanted a bed of his own.\nGrandmother didn’t object.\nHis mother took him to a department store in Brooklyn, winked at the\nsalesgirl, and said: ‘Here is a little gentleman who would like to do some\nshopping.’\nThe salesgirl made him feel important by saying: ‘Young man, what\ncan I show you?’\nHe stood a couple of inches taller and said: ‘I want to buy a bed for\nmyself.’\nWhen he was shown the one his mother wanted him to buy, she\nwinked at the salesgirl and the boy was persuaded to buy it.\nThe bed was delivered the next day; and that night, when Father came\nhome, the little boy ran to the door shouting: ‘Daddy! Daddy! Come\nupstairs and see my bed that I bought!’\nThe father, looking at the bed, obeyed Charles Schwab’s injunction: he\nwas ‘hearty in his approbation and lavish in his praise.’\n‘You are not going to wet this bed, are you?’ the father said.\n‘Oh no, no! I am not going to wet this bed.’ The boy kept his promise,\nfor his pride was involved. That was his bed. He and he alone had bought it.","And he was wearing pyjamas now like a little man. He wanted to act like a\nman. And he did.\nAnother father, K.T. Dutschmann, a telephone engineer, a student of\nthis course, couldn’t get his three-year-old daughter to eat breakfast food.\nThe usual scolding, pleading, coaxing methods had all ended in futility. So\nthe parents asked themselves: ‘How can we make her want to do it?’\nThe little girl loved to imitate her mother, to feel big and grown up; so\none morning they put her on a chair and let her make the breakfast food. At\njust the psychological moment, Father drifted into the kitchen while she\nwas stirring the cereal and she said: ‘Oh, look, Daddy, I am making the\ncereal this morning.’\nShe ate two helpings of the cereal without any coaxing, because she\nwas interested in it. She had achieved a feeling of importance; she had\nfound in making the cereal an avenue of self-expression.\nWilliam Winter once remarked that ‘self-expression is the dominant\nnecessity of human nature.’ Why can’t we adapt this same psychology to\nbusiness dealings? When we have a brilliant idea, instead of making others\nthink it is ours, why not let them cook and stir the idea themselves. They\nwill then regard it as their own; they will like it and maybe eat a couple of\nhelpings of it.\nRemember: ‘First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who\ncan do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely\nway.’\nPRINCIPLE 3\nArouse in the other person an eager want.","IN A NUTSHELL\nFUNDAMENTAL TECHNIQUES IN HANDLING PEOPLE\nPRINCIPLE 1\nDon’t criticise, condemn or complain.\nPRINCIPLE 2\nGive honest and sincere appreciation.\nPRINCIPLE 3\nArouse in the other person an eager want.","WHY READ THIS book to find out how to win friends? Why not study the\ntechnique of the greatest winner of friends the world has ever known? Who\nis he? You may meet him tomorrow coming down the street. When you get\nwithin ten feet of him, he will begin to wag his tail. If you stop and pat him\nhe will almost jump out of his skin to show you how much he likes you.\nAnd you know that behind this show of affection on his part, there are no\nulterior motives: he doesn’t want to sell you any real estate, and he doesn’t\nwant to marry you.\nDid you ever stop to think that a dog is the only animal that doesn’t\nhave to work for a living? A hen has to lay eggs, a cow has to give milk,\nand a canary has to sing. But a dog makes his living by giving you nothing\nbut love.\nWhen I was five years old, my father bought a little yellow-haired pup\nfor fifty cents. He was the light and joy of my childhood. Every afternoon\nabout four-thirty, he would sit in the front yard with his beautiful eyes\nstaring steadfastly at the path, and as soon as he heard my voice or saw me\nswinging my dinner pail through the buck brush, he was off like a shot,\nracing breathlessly up the hill to greet me with leaps of joy and barks of\nsheer ecstasy.\nTippy was my constant companion for five years. Then one tragic\nnight – I shall never forget it – he was killed within ten feet of my head,\nkilled by lightning. Tippy’s death was the tragedy of my boyhood.\nYou never read a book on psychology, Tippy. You didn’t need to. You\nknew by some divine instinct that you can make more friends in two\nmonths by becoming genuinely interested in other people than you can in\ntwo years by trying to get other people interested in you. Let me repeat that.\nYou can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other\npeople than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in\nyou.","Yet I know and you know people who blunder through life trying to\nwigwag other people into becoming interested in them.\nOf course, it doesn’t work. People are not interested in you. They are\nnot interested in me. They are interested in themselves – morning, noon and\nafter dinner.\nThe New York Telephone Company made a detailed study of\ntelephone conversations to find out which word is the most frequently used.\nYou have guessed it: it is the personal pronoun ‘I.’ ‘I.’ ‘I.’ It was used 3,900\ntimes in 500 telephone conversations. ‘I.’ ‘I.’ ‘I.’ ‘I.’\nWhen you see a group photograph that you are in, whose picture do\nyou look for first?\nIf we merely try to impress people and get people interested in us, we\nwill never have many true, sincere friends. Friends, real friends, are not\nmade that way.\nNapoleon tried it, and in his last meeting with Josephine he said:\n‘Josephine, I have been as fortunate as any man ever was on this earth; and\nyet, at this hour, you are the only person in the world on whom I can rely.’\nAnd historians doubt whether he could rely even on her.\nAlfred Adler, the famous Viennese psychologist, wrote a book entitled\nWhat Life Should Mean to You. In that book he says: ‘It is the individual\nwho is not interested in his fellow men who has the greatest difficulties in\nlife and provides the greatest injury to others. It is from among such\nindividuals that all human failures spring.’\nYou may read scores of erudite tomes on psychology without coming\nacross a statement more significant for you and me. Adler’s statement is so\nrich with meaning that I am going to repeat it in italics:\nIt is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who\nhas the greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest\ninjury to others. It is from among such individuals that all\nhuman failures spring.\nI once took a course in short-story writing at New York University, and\nduring that course the editor of a leading magazine talked to our class. He\nsaid he could pick up any one of the dozens of stories that drifted across his\ndesk every day and after reading a few paragraphs he could feel whether or","not the author liked people. ‘If the author doesn’t like people,’ he said,\n‘people won’t like his or her stories.’\nThis hard-boiled editor stopped twice in the course of his talk on\nfiction writing and apologised for preaching a sermon. ‘I am telling you,’ he\nsaid, ‘the same things your preacher would tell you, but remember, you\nhave to be interested in people if you want to be a successful writer of\nstories.’\nIf that is true of writing fiction, you can be sure it is true of dealing\nwith people face-to-face.\nI spent an evening in the dressing room of Howard Thurston the last\ntime he appeared on Broadway – Thurston was the acknowledged dean of\nmagicians. For forty years he had travelled all over the world, time and\nagain, creating illusions, mystifying audiences, and making people gasp\nwith astonishment. More than 60 million people had paid admission to his\nshow, and he had made almost $2 million in profit.\nI asked Mr. Thurston to tell me the secret of his success. His schooling\ncertainly had nothing to do with it, for he ran away from home as a small\nboy, became a hobo, rode in boxcars, slept in haystacks, begged his food\nfrom door to door, and learned to read by looking out of boxcars at signs\nalong the railway.\nDid he have a superior knowledge of magic? No, he told me hundreds\nof books had been written about legerdemain and scores of people knew as\nmuch about it as he did. But he had two things that the others didn’t have.\nFirst, he had the ability to put his personality across the footlights. He was a\nmaster showman. He knew human nature. Everything he did, every gesture,\nevery intonation of his voice, every lifting of an eyebrow had been carefully\nrehearsed in advance, and his actions were timed to split seconds. But, in\naddition to that, Thurston had a genuine interest in people. He told me that\nmany magicians would look at the audience and say to themselves, ‘Well,\nthere is a bunch of suckers out there, a bunch of hicks; I’ll fool them all\nright.’ But Thurston’s method was totally different. He told me that every\ntime he went on stage he said to himself: ‘I am grateful because these\npeople come to see me. They make it possible for me to make my living in\na very agreeable way. I’m going to give them the very best I possibly can.’\nHe declared he never stepped in front of the footlights without first\nsaying to himself over and over: ‘I love my audience. I love my audience.’\nRidiculous? Absurd? You are privileged to think anything you like. I am","merely passing it on to you without comment as a recipe used by one of the\nmost famous magicians of all time.\nGeorge Dyke of North Warren, Pennsylvania, was forced to retire from\nhis service station business after thirty years when a new highway was\nconstructed over the site of his station. It wasn’t long before the idle days of\nretirement began to bore him, so he started filling in his time trying to play\nmusic and talk with many of the accomplished fiddlers. In his humble and\nfriendly way he became generally interested in learning the background and\ninterests of every musician he met. Although he was not a great fiddler\nhimself, he made many friends in this pursuit. He attended competitions and\nsoon became known to the country music fans in the eastern part of the\nUnited States as ‘Uncle George, the Fiddle Scraper from Kinzua County.’\nWhen we heard Uncle George, he was seventy-two and enjoying every\nminute of his life. By having a sustained interest in other people, he created\na new life for himself at a time when most people consider their productive\nyears over.\nThat, too, was one of the secrets of Theodore Roosevelt’s astonishing\npopularity. Even his servants loved him. His valet, James E. Amos, wrote a\nbook about him entitled Theodore Roosevelt, Hero to His Valet. In that book\nAmos relates this illuminating incident:\nMy wife one time asked the President about a bobwhite.\nShe had never seen one and he described it to her fully.\nSometime later, the telephone at our cottage rang. [Amos and\nhis wife lived in a little cottage on the Roosevelt estate at\nOyster Bay.] My wife answered it and it was Mr. Roosevelt\nhimself. He had called her, he said, to tell her that there was a\nbobwhite outside her window and that if she would look out\nshe might see it. Little things like that were so characteristic\nof him. Whenever he went by our cottage even though we\nwere out of sight, we would hear him call out: ‘Oo-oo-oo,\nAnnie?’ or ‘Oo-oo-oo, James!’ It was just a friendly greeting\nas he went by.\nHow could employees keep from liking a man like that? How could anyone\nkeep from liking him?","Roosevelt called at the White House one day when the President and\nMrs. Taft were away. His honest liking for humble people was shown by the\nfact that he greeted all the old White House servants by name, even the\nscullery maids.\n‘But when he saw Alice, the kitchen maid,’ writes Archie Butt, ‘he\nasked her if she still made corn bread. Alice told him that she sometimes\nmade it for the servants, but no one ate it upstairs.\n‘“They show bad taste,” Roosevelt boomed, “and I’ll tell the President\nso when I see him.”\n‘Alice brought a piece to him on a plate, and he went over to the office\neating it as he went and greeting gardeners and labourers as he passed . . .\n‘He addressed each person just as he had addressed them in the past.\nIke Hoover, who had been head usher at the White House for forty years,\nsaid with tears in his eyes: “It is the only happy day we had in nearly two\nyears, and not one of us would exchange it for a hundred-dollar bill.”’\nThe same concern for the seemingly unimportant people helped sales\nrepresentative Edward M. Sykes, Jr., of Chatham, New Jersey, retain an\naccount. ‘Many years ago,’ he reported, ‘I called on customers for Johnson\nand Johnson in the Massachusetts area. One account was a drug store in\nHingham. Whenever I went into this store I would always talk to the soda\nclerk and sales clerk for a few minutes before talking to the owner to obtain\nhis order. One day I went up to the owner of the store, and he told me to\nleave as he was not interested in buying J&J products anymore because he\nfelt they were concentrating their activities on food and discount stores to\nthe detriment of the small drugstore. I left with my tail between my legs and\ndrove around the town for several hours. Finally, I decided to go back and\ntry at least to explain our position to the owner of the store.\n‘When I returned I walked in and as usual said hello to the soda clerk\nand sales clerk. When I walked up to the owner, he smiled at me and\nwelcomed me back. He then gave me double the usual order. I looked at\nhim with surprise and asked him what had happened since my visit only a\nfew hours earlier. He pointed to the young man at the soda fountain and said\nthat after I had left, the boy had come over and said that I was one of the\nfew salespeople that called on the store that even bothered to say hello to\nhim and to the others in the store. He told the owner that if any salesperson\ndeserved his business, it was I. The owner agreed and remained a loyal\ncustomer. I never forgot that to be genuinely interested in other people is a","most important quality for a salesperson to possess – for any person, for\nthat matter.’\nI have discovered from personal experience that one can win the\nattention and time and cooperation of even the most sought-after people by\nbecoming genuinely interested in them. Let me illustrate.\nYears ago I conducted a course in fiction writing at the Brooklyn\nInstitute of Arts and Sciences, and we wanted such distinguished and busy\nauthors as Kathleen Norris, Fannie Hurst, Ida Tarbell, Albert Payson\nTerhune and Rupert Hughes to come to Brooklyn and give us the benefit of\ntheir experiences. So we wrote them, saying we admired their work and\nwere deeply interested in getting their advice and learning the secrets of\ntheir success.\nEach of these letters was signed by about a hundred and fifty students.\nWe said we realised that these authors were busy – too busy to prepare a\nlecture. So we enclosed a list of questions for them to answer about\nthemselves and their methods of work. They liked that. Who wouldn’t like\nit? So they left their homes and travelled to Brooklyn to give us a helping\nhand.\nBy using the same method, I persuaded Leslie M. Shaw, secretary of\nthe treasury in Theodore Roosevelt’s cabinet; George W. Wickersham,\nattorney general in Taft’s cabinet; William Jennings Bryan; Franklin D.\nRoosevelt and many other prominent men to come to talk to the students of\nmy courses in public speaking.\nAll of us, be we workers in a factory, clerks in an office or even a king\nupon his throne – all of us like people who admire us. Take the German\nKaiser, for example. At the close of World War I he was probably the most\nsavagely and universally despised man on this earth. Even his own nation\nturned against him when he fled over into Holland to save his neck. The\nhatred against him was so intense that millions of people would have loved\nto tear him limb from limb or burn him at the stake. In the midst of all this\nforest fire of fury, one little boy wrote the Kaiser a simple, sincere letter\nglowing with kindliness and admiration. This little boy said that no matter\nwhat the others thought, he would always love Wilhelm as his Emperor.\nThe Kaiser was deeply touched by this letter and invited the little boy to\ncome to see him. The boy came, so did his mother – and the Kaiser married\nher. That little boy didn’t need to read a book on how to win friends and\ninfluence people. He knew how instinctively.","If we want to make friends, let’s put ourselves out to do things for\nother people – things that require time, energy, unselfishness and\nthoughtfulness. When the Duke of Windsor was Prince of Wales, he was\nscheduled to tour South America, and before he started out on that tour he\nspent months studying Spanish so that he could make public talks in the\nlanguage of the country; and the South Americans loved him for it.\nFor years I made it a point to find out the birthdays of my friends.\nHow? Although I haven’t the foggiest bit of faith in astrology, I began by\nasking the other party whether he believed the date of one’s birth has\nanything to do with character and disposition. I then asked him or her to tell\nme the month and day of birth. If he or she said November 24, for example,\nI kept repeating to myself, ‘November 24, November 24.’ The minute my\nfriend’s back was turned I wrote down the name and birthday and later\nwould transfer it to a birthday book. At the beginning of each year, I had\nthese birthday dates scheduled in my calendar pad so that they came to my\nattention automatically. When the natal day arrived, there was my letter or\ntelegram. What a hit it made! I was frequently the only person on earth who\nremembered.\nIf we want to make friends, let’s greet people with animation and\nenthusiasm. When somebody calls you on the telephone use the same\npsychology. Say ‘Hello’ in tones that bespeak how pleased you are to have\nthe person call. Many companies train their telephone operators to greet all\ncallers in a tone of voice that radiates interest and enthusiasm. The caller\nfeels the company is concerned about them. Let’s remember that when we\nanswer the telephone tomorrow.\nShowing a genuine interest in others not only wins friends for you, but\nmay develop in its customers a loyalty to your company. In an issue of the\npublication of the National Bank of North America of New York, the\nfollowing letter from Madeline Rosedale, a depositor, was published:\n1\n‘I would like you to know how much I appreciate your staff. Everyone\nis so courteous, polite and helpful. What a pleasure it is, after waiting on a\nlong line, to have the teller greet you pleasantly.\n‘Last year my mother was hospitalised for five months. Frequently I\nwent to Marie Petrucello, a teller. She was concerned about my mother and\ninquired about her progress.’\nIs there any doubt that Mrs Rosedale will continue to use this bank?","Charles R. Walters, of one of the large banks in New York City, was\nassigned to prepare a confidential report on a certain corporation. He knew\nof only one person who possessed the facts he needed so urgently. As Mr.\nWalters was ushered into the president’s office, a young woman stuck her\nhead through a door and told the president that she didn’t have any stamps\nfor him that day.\n‘I am collecting stamps for my twelve-year-old son,’ the president\nexplained to Mr. Walters.\nMr. Walters stated his mission and began asking questions. The\npresident was vague, general, nebulous. He didn’t want to talk, and\napparently nothing could persuade him to talk. The interview was brief and\nbarren.\n‘Frankly, I didn’t know what to do,’ Mr. Walters said as he related the\nstory to the class. ‘Then I remembered what his secretary had said to him –\nstamps, twelve-year-old son . . . And I also recalled that the foreign\ndepartment of our bank collected stamps – stamps taken from letters\npouring in from every continent washed by the seven seas.\n‘The next afternoon I called on this man and sent in word that I had\nsome stamps for his boy. Was I ushered in with enthusiasm? Yes sir. He\ncouldn’t have shaken my hand with more enthusiasm if he had been running\nfor Congress. He radiated smiles and good will. “My George will love this\none,” he kept saying as he fondled the stamps. “And look at this! This is a\ntreasure.”\n‘We spent half an hour talking stamps and looking at a picture of his\nboy, and then he devoted more than an hour of his time to giving me every\nbit of information I wanted – without my even suggesting that he do it. He\ntold me all he knew, and then called in his subordinates and questioned\nthem. He telephoned some of his associates. He loaded me down with facts,\nfigures, reports and correspondence. In the parlance of newspaper reporters,\nI had a scoop.’\nHere is another illustration:\nC.M. Knaphle, Jr., of Philadelphia had tried for years to sell fuel to a\nlarge chain-store organisation. But the chain-store company continued to\npurchase its fuel from an out-of-town dealer and haul it right past the door\nof Knaphle’s office. Mr. Knaphle made a speech one night before one of my\nclasses, pouring out his hot wrath upon chain stores, branding them as a\ncurse to the nation.","And still he wondered why he couldn’t sell them.\nI suggested that he try different tactics. To put it briefly, this is what\nhappened. We staged a debate between members of the course on whether\nthe spread of the chain store is doing the country more harm that good.\nKnaphle, at my suggestion, took the negative side; he agreed to defend\nthe chain store, and then went straight to an executive of the chain-store\norganisation that he despised and said: ‘I am not here to try to sell fuel. I\nhave come to ask you to do me a favour.’ He then told about his debate and\nsaid, ‘I have come to you for help because I can’t think of anyone else who\nwould be more capable of giving me the facts I want. I’m anxious to win\nthis debate, and I’ll deeply appreciate whatever help you can give me.’\nHere is the rest of the story in Mr. Knaphle’s own words:\nI had asked this man for precisely one minute of his time. It\nwas with that understanding that he consented to see me.\nAfter I had stated my case, he motioned me to a chair and\ntalked to me for exactly one hour and forty-seven minutes. He\ncalled in another executive who had written a book on chain\nstores. He wrote to the National Chain Store Association and\nsecured for me a copy of a debate on the subject. He feels that\nthe chain store is rendering a real service to humanity. He is\nproud of what he is doing for hundreds of communities. His\neyes fairly glowed as he talked, and I must confess that he\nopened my eyes to things I had never even dreamed of. He\nchanged my whole mental attitude.\nAs I was leaving, he walked with me to the door, put his\narm around my shoulder, wished me well in my debate, and\nasked me to stop in and see him again and let him know how I\nmade out. The last words he said to me were: ‘Please see me\nagain later in the spring. I should like to place an order with\nyou for fuel.’\nTo me that was almost a miracle. Here he was offering to\nbuy fuel without my even suggesting it. I had made more\nheadway in two hours by becoming genuinely interested in\nhim and his problems than I could have made in ten years\ntrying to get him interested in me and my product.","You didn’t discover a new truth, Mr. Knaphle, for a long time ago, a\nhundred years before Christ was born, a famous old Roman poet, Publilius\nSyrus, remarked: ‘We are interested in others when they are interested in\nus.’\nA show of interest, as with every other principle of human relations,\nmust be sincere. It must pay off not only for the person showing the interest,\nbut for the person receiving the attention. It is a two-way street – both\nparties benefit.\nMartin Ginsberg, who took our course in Long Island, New York,\nreported how the special interest a nurse took in him profoundly affected his\nlife:\n‘It was Thanksgiving Day and I was ten years old. I was in a welfare\nward of a city hospital and was scheduled to undergo major orthopedic\nsurgery the next day. I knew that I could only look forward to months of\nconfinement, convalescence and pain. My father was dead; my mother and I\nlived alone in a small apartment and we were on welfare. My mother was\nunable to visit me that day.\n‘As the day went on, I became overwhelmed with the feeling of\nloneliness, despair and fear. I knew my mother was at home alone worrying\nabout me, not having anyone to be with, not having anyone to eat with and\nnot even having enough money to afford a Thanksgiving Day dinner.\n‘The tears welled up in my eyes, and I stuck my head under the pillow\nand pulled the covers over it. I cried silently, but oh so bitterly, so much that\nmy body racked with pain.\n‘A young student nurse heard my sobbing and came over to me. She\ntook the covers off my face and started wiping my tears. She told me how\nlonely she was, having to work that day and not being able to be with her\nfamily. She asked me whether I would have dinner with her. She brought\ntwo trays of food: sliced turkey, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce and ice\ncream for dessert. She talked to me and tried to calm my fears. Even though\nshe was scheduled to go off duty at 4 P.M., she stayed on her own time until\nalmost 11 P.M.. She played games with me, talked to me and stayed with\nme until I finally fell asleep.\n‘Many Thanksgivings have come and gone since I was ten, but one\nnever passes without me remembering that particular one and my feelings\nof frustration, fear, loneliness and the warmth and tenderness of the stranger\nthat somehow made it all bearable.’","If you want others to like you, if you want to develop real friendships,\nif you want to help others at the same time as you help yourself, keep this\nprinciple in mind;\nPRINCIPLE 1\nBecome genuinely interested in other people.\n1.\nEagle, publication of the National Bank of North America, New York, March 31, 1978.","AT A DINNER party in New York, one of the guests, a woman who had\ninherited money, was eager to make a pleasing impression on everyone. She\nhad squandered a modest fortune on sables, diamonds and pearls. But she\nhadn’t done anything whatever about her face. It radiated sourness and\nselfishness. She didn’t realise what everyone knows: namely, that the\nexpression one wears on one’s face is far more important than the clothes\none wears on one’s back.\nCharles Schwab told me his smile had been worth a million dollars.\nAnd he was probably understating the truth. For Schwab’s personality, his\ncharm, his ability to make people like him, were almost wholly responsible\nfor his extraordinary success; and one of the most delightful factors in his\npersonality was his captivating smile.\nActions speak louder than words, and a smile says, ‘I like you. You\nmake me happy. I am glad to see you.’\nThat is why dogs make such a hit. They are so glad to see us that they\nalmost jump out of their skins. So, naturally, we are glad to see them.\nA baby’s smile has the same effect.\nHave you ever been in a doctor’s waiting room and looked around at\nall the glum faces waiting impatiently to be seen? Dr. Stephen K. Sproul, a\nveterinarian in Raytown, Missouri, told of a typical spring day when his\nwaiting room was full of clients waiting to have their pets inoculated. No\none was talking to anyone else, and all were probably thinking of a dozen\nother things they would rather be doing than ‘wasting time’ sitting in that\noffice. He told one of our classes: ‘There were six or seven clients waiting\nwhen a young woman came in with a nine-months-old baby and a kitten. As\nluck would have it, she sat down next to a gentleman who was more than a\nlittle distraught about the long wait for service. The next thing he knew, the\nbaby just looked up at him with that great big smile that is so characteristic\nof babies. What did that gentleman do? Just what you and I would do, of","course; he smiled back at the baby. Soon he struck up a conversation with\nthe woman about her baby and his grandchildren, and soon the entire\nreception room joined in, and the boredom and tension were converted into\na pleasant and enjoyable experience.’\nAn insincere grin? No. That doesn’t fool anybody. We know it is\nmechanical and we resent it. I am talking about a real smile, a heartwarming\nsmile, a smile that comes from within, the kind of smile that will bring a\ngood price in the marketplace.\nProfessor James V. McConnell, a psychologist at the University of\nMichigan, expressed his feelings about a smile. ‘People who smile,’ he said,\n‘tend to manage, teach and sell more effectively, and to raise happier\nchildren. There’s far more information in a smile than a frown. That’s why\nencouragement is a much more effective teaching device than punishment.’\nThe employment manager of a large New York department store told\nme she would rather hire a sales clerk who hadn’t finished grade school, if\nhe or she has a pleasant smile, than to hire a doctor of philosophy with a\nsombre face.\nThe effect of a smile is powerful – even when it is unseen. Telephone\ncompanies throughout the United States have a programme called ‘phone\npower’ which is offered to employees who use the telephone for selling\ntheir services or products. In this programme they suggest that you smile\nwhen talking on the phone. Your ‘smile’ comes through in your voice.\nRobert Cryer, manager of a computer department for a Cincinnati,\nOhio, company, told how he had successfully found the right applicant for a\nhard-to-fill position:\n‘I was desperately trying to recruit a Ph.D. in computer science for my\ndepartment. I finally located a young man with ideal qualification who was\nabout to be graduated from Purdue University. After several phone\nconversations I learned that he had several offers from other companies,\nmany of them larger and better known than mine. I was delighted when he\naccepted my offer. After he started on the job, I asked him why he had\nchosen us over the others. He paused for a moment and then he said: “I\nthink it was because managers in the other companies spoke on the phone in\na cold, businesslike manner, which made me feel like just another business\ntransaction. Your voice sounded as if you were glad to hear from me . . .\nthat you really wanted me to be part of your organisation.” You can be\nassured, I am still answering my phone with a smile.’","The chairman of the board of directors of one of the largest rubber\ncompanies in the United States told me that, according to his observations,\npeople rarely succeed at anything unless they have fun doing it. This\nindustrial leader doesn’t put much faith in the old adage that hard work\nalone is the magic key that will unlock the door to our desires. ‘I have\nknown people,’ he said, ‘who succeeded because they had a rip-roaring\ngood time conducting their business. Later, I saw those people change as\nthe fun became work. The business had grown dull. They lost all joy in it,\nand they failed.’\nYou must have a good time meeting people if you expect them to have\na good time meeting you.\nI have asked thousands of business people to smile at someone every\nhour of the day for a week and then come to class and talk about the results.\nHow did it work? Let’s see . . . Here is a letter from William B. Steinhardt,\na New York stockbroker. His case isn’t isolated. In fact, it is typical of\nhundreds of cases.\n‘I have been married for over eighteen years,’ wrote Mr. Steinhardt,\n‘and in all that time I seldom smiled at my wife or spoke two dozen words\nto her from the time I got up until I was ready to leave for business. I was\none of the worst grouches who ever walked down Broadway.\n‘When you asked me to make a talk about my experience with smiles,\nI thought I would try it for a week. So the next morning, while combing my\nhair, I looked at my glum mug in the mirror and said to myself, “Bill, you\nare going to wipe the scowl off that sour puss of yours today. You are going\nto smile. And you are going to begin right now.” As I sat down to breakfast,\nI greeted my wife with a “Good morning, my dear,” and smiled as I said it.\n‘You warned me that she might be surprised. Well, you underestimated\nher reaction. She was bewildered. She was shocked. I told her that in the\nfuture she could expect this as a regular occurrence, and I kept it up every\nmorning.\n‘This changed attitude of mine brought more happiness into our home\nin the two months since I started than there was during the last year.\n‘As I leave for my office, I greet the elevator operator in the apartment\nhouse with a “Good morning” and a smile. I greet the doorman with a\nsmile. I smile at the cashier in the subway booth when I ask for change. As\nI stand on the floor of the Stock Exchange, I smile at people who until\nrecently never saw me smile.","‘I soon found that everybody was smiling back at me. I treat those who\ncome to me with complaints or grievances in a cheerful manner. I smile as I\nlisten to them and I find that adjustments are accomplished much easier. I\nfind that smiles are bringing me dollars, many dollars every day.\n‘I share my office with another broker. One of his clerks is a likable\nyoung chap, and I was so elated about the results I was getting that I told\nhim recently about my new philosophy of human relations. He then\nconfessed that when I first came to share my office with his firm he thought\nme a terrible grouch – and only recently changed his mind. He said I was\nreally human when I smiled.\n‘I have also eliminated criticism from my system. I give appreciation\nand praise now instead of condemnation. I have stopped talking about what\nI want. I am now trying to see the other person’s viewpoint. And these\nthings have literally revolutionised my life. I am a totally different man, a\nhappier man, a richer man, richer in friendships and happiness – the only\nthings that matter much after all.’\nYou don’t feel like smiling? Then what? Two things. First, force\nyourself to smile. If you are alone, force yourself to whistle or hum a tune\nor sing. Act as if you were already happy, and that will tend to make you\nhappy. Here is the way the psychologist and philosopher William James put\nit:\n‘Action seems to follow feeling, but really action and feeling go\ntogether; and by regulating the action, which is under the more direct\ncontrol of the will, we can indirectly regulate the feeling, which is not.\n‘Thus the sovereign voluntary path to cheerfulness, if our cheerfulness\nbe lost, is to sit up cheerfully and to act and speak as if cheerfulness were\nalready there . . .’\nEverybody in the world is seeking happiness – and there is one sure\nway to find it. That is by controlling your thoughts. Happiness doesn’t\ndepend on outward conditions. It depends on inner conditions.\nIt isn’t what you have or who you are or where you are or what you are\ndoing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about it. For\nexample, two people may be in the same place, doing the same thing; both\nmay have about an equal amount of money and prestige – and yet one may\nbe miserable and the other happy. Why? Because of a different mental\nattitude. I have seen just as many happy faces among the poor peasants","toiling with their primitive tools in the devastating heat of the tropics as I\nhave seen in air-conditioned offices in New York, Chicago or Los Angeles.\n‘There is nothing either good or bad,’ said Shakespeare, ‘but thinking\nmakes it so.’\nAbe Lincoln once remarked that ‘most folks are about as happy as they\nmake up their minds to be.’ He was right. I saw a vivid illustration of that\ntruth as I was walking up the stairs of the Long Island Railroad station in\nNew York. Directly in front of me thirty or forty crippled boys on canes and\ncrutches were struggling up the stairs. One boy had to be carried up. I was\nastonished at their laughter and gaiety. I spoke about it to one of the men in\ncharge of the boys. ‘Oh, yes,’ he said, ‘when a boy realises that he is going\nto be a cripple for life, he is shocked at first; but after he gets over the\nshock, he usually resigns himself to his fate and then becomes as happy as\nnormal boys.’\nI felt like taking my hat off to those boys. They taught me a lesson I\nhope I shall never forget.\nWorking all by oneself in a closed-off room in an office not only is\nlonely, but it denies one the opportunity of making friends with other\nemployees in the company. Señora Maria Gonzalez of Guadalajara, Mexico,\nhad such a job. She envied the shared comradeship of other people in the\ncompany as she heard their chatter and laughter. As she passed them in the\nhall during the first weeks of her employment, she shyly looked the other\nway.\nAfter a few weeks, she said to herself, ‘Maria, you can’t expect those\nwomen to come to you. You have to go out and meet them.’ The next time\nshe walked to the water cooler, she put on her brightest smile and said, ‘Hi,\nhow are you today’ to each of the people she met. The effect was\nimmediate. Smiles and hellos were returned, the hallway seemed brighter,\nthe job friendlier. Acquaintanceships developed and some ripened into\nfriendships. Her job and her life became more pleasant and interesting.\nPeruse this bit of sage advice from the essayist and publisher Elbert\nHubbard – but remember, perusing it won’t do you any good unless you\napply it:\nWhenever you go out-of-doors, draw the chin in, carry the\ncrown of the head high, and fill the lungs to the utmost; drink in\nthe sunshine; greet your friends with a smile, and put soul into","every handclasp. Do not fear being misunderstood and do not\nwaste a minute thinking about your enemies. Try to fix firmly in\nyour mind what you would like to do; and then, without veering\noff direction, you will move straight to the goal. Keep your mind\non the great and splendid things you would like to do, and then, as\nthe days go gliding away, you will find yourself unconsciously\nseizing upon the opportunities that are required for the fulfillment\nof your desire, just as the coral insect takes from the running tide\nthe element it needs. Picture in your mind the able, earnest, useful\nperson you desire to be, and the thought you hold is hourly\ntransforming you into that particular individual . . . Thought is\nsupreme. Preserve a right mental attitude – the attitude of\ncourage, frankness, and good cheer. To think rightly is to create.\nAll things come through desire and every sincere prayer is\nanswered. We become like that on which our hearts are fixed.\nCarry your chin in and the crown of your head high. We are gods\nin the chrysalis.\nThe ancient Chinese were a wise lot – wise in the ways of the world; and\nthey had a proverb that you and I ought to cut out and paste inside our hats.\nIt goes like this: ‘A man without a smiling face must not open a shop.’\nYour smile is a messenger of your good will. Your smile brightens the\nlives of all who see it. To someone who has seen a dozen people frown,\nscowl or turn their faces away, your smile is like the sun breaking through\nthe clouds. Especially when that someone is under pressure from his bosses,\nhis customers, his teachers or parents or children, a smile can help him\nrealise that all is not hopeless – that there is joy in the world.\nSome years ago, a department store in New York City, in recognition\nof the pressures its sales clerks were under during the Christmas rush,\npresented the readers of its advertisements with the following homely\nphilosophy:\nThe Value of a Smile at Christmas\nIt costs nothing, but creates much.\nIt enriches those who receive, without impoverishing those who give.\nIt happens in a flash and the memory of it sometimes lasts forever.","None are so rich they can get along without it, and none so poor but\nare richer for its benefits.\nIt creates happiness in the home, fosters good will in a business, and is\nthe countersign of friends.\nIt is rest to the weary, daylight to the discouraged, sunshine to the sad,\nand Nature’s best antidote for trouble.\nYet it cannot be bought, begged, borrowed, or stolen, for it is\nsomething that is no earthly good to anybody till it is given away.\nAnd if in the last-minute rush of Christmas buying some of our\nsalespeople should be too tired to give you a smile, may we ask you to\nleave one of yours?\nFor nobody needs a smile so much as those who have none left to\ngive!\nPRINCIPLE 2\nSmile.","BACK IN 1898, a tragic thing happened in Rockland County, New York. A\nchild had died, and on this particular day the neighbours were preparing to\ngo to the funeral. Jim Farley went out to the barn to hitch up his horse. The\nground was covered with snow, the air was cold and snappy; the horse\nhadn’t been exercised for days, and as he was led out to the watering\ntrough, he wheeled playfully, kicked both his heels high in the air, and\nkilled Jim Farley. So the little village of Stony Point had two funerals that\nweek instead of one.\nJim Farley left behind him a widow and three boys, and a few hundred\ndollars in insurance.\nHis oldest boy, Jim, was ten, and he went to work in a brickyard,\nwheeling sand and pouring it into the moulds and turning the brick on edge\nto be dried by the sun. This boy Jim never had a chance to get much\neducation. But with his natural geniality, he had a flair for making people\nlike him, so he went into politics, and as the years went by, he developed an\nuncanny ability for remembering people’s names.\nHe never saw the inside of a high school; but before he was forty-six\nyears of age, four colleges had honoured him with degrees and he had\nbecome chairman of the Democratic National Committee and Postmaster\nGeneral of the United States.\nI once interviewed Jim Farley and asked him the secret of his success.\nHe said, ‘Hard work,’ and I said, ‘Don’t be funny.’\nHe then asked me what I thought was the reason for his success. I\nreplied: ‘I understand you can call ten thousand people by their first names.’\n‘No. You are wrong,’ he said. ‘I can call fifty thousand people by their\nfirst names.’\nMake no mistake about it. That ability helped Mr. Farley put Franklin\nD. Roosevelt in the White House when he managed Roosevelt’s campaign\nin 1932.","During the years that Jim Farley travelled as a salesman for a gypsum\nconcern, and during the years that he held office as town clerk in Stony\nPoint, he built up a system for remembering names.\nIn the beginning, it was a very simple one. Whenever he met a new\nacquaintance, he found out his or her complete name and some facts about\nhis or her family, business and political opinions. He fixed all these facts\nwell in mind as part of the picture, and the next time he met that person,\neven if it was a year later, he was able to shake hands, inquire after the\nfamily, and ask about the hollyhocks in the backyard. No wonder he\ndeveloped a following!\nFor months before Roosevelt’s campaign for President began, Jim\nFarley wrote hundreds of letters a day to people all over the western and\nnorthwestern states. Then he hopped onto a train and in nineteen days\ncovered twenty states and twelve thousand miles, travelling by buggy, train,\nautomobile and boat. He would drop into town to meet his people at lunch\nor breakfast, tea or dinner, and give them a ‘heart-to-heart talk.’ Then he’d\ndash off again on another leg of his journey.\nAs soon as he arrived back East, he wrote to one person in each town\nhe had visited, asking for a list of all the guests to whom he had talked. The\nfinal list contained thousands and thousands of names: yet each person on\nthat list was paid the subtle flattery of getting a personal letter from James\nFarley. These letters began ‘Dear Bill’ or ‘Dear Jane,’ and they were always\nsigned ‘Jim.’\nJim Farley discovered early in life that the average person is more\ninterested in his or her own name than in all the other names on earth put\ntogether. Remember that name and call it easily, and you have paid a subtle\nand very effective compliment. But forget it or misspell it – and you have\nplaced yourself at a sharp disadvantage. For example, I once organised a\npublic speaking course in Paris and sent form letters to all the American\nresidents in the city. French typists with apparently little knowledge of\nEnglish filled in the names and naturally they made blunders. One man, the\nmanager of a large American bank in Paris, wrote me a scathing rebuke\nbecause his name had been misspelled.\nSometimes it is difficult to remember a name, particularly if it is hard\nto pronounce. Rather than even try to learn it, many people ignore it or call\nthe person by an easy nickname. Sid Levy called on a customer for some\ntime whose name was Nicodemus Papadoulos. Most people just called him","‘Nick.’ Levy told us: ‘I made a special effort to say his name over several\ntimes to myself before I made my call. When I greeted him by his full\nname: “Good afternoon, Mr. Nicodemus Papadoulos,” he was shocked. For\nwhat seemed like several minutes there was no reply from him at all.\nFinally, he said with tears rolling down his cheeks, “Mr. Levy, in all the\nfifteen years I have been in this country, nobody has ever made the effort to\ncall me by my right name.”’\nWhat was the reason for Andrew Carnegie’s success?\nHe was called the Steel King; yet he himself knew little about the\nmanufacture of steel. He had hundreds of people working for him who\nknew far more about steel than he did.\nBut he knew how to handle people, and that is what made him rich.\nEarly in life, he showed a flair for organisation, a genius for leadership. By\nthe time he was ten, he too had discovered the astounding importance\npeople place on their own name. And he used that discovery to win\ncooperation. To illustrate: When he was a boy back in Scotland, he got hold\nof a rabbit, a mother rabbit. Presto! He soon had a whole nest of little\nrabbits – and nothing to feed them. But he had a brilliant idea. He told the\nboys and girls in the neighbourhood that if they would go out and pull\nenough clover and dandelions to feed the rabbits, he would name the\nbunnies in their honour.\nThe plan worked like magic, and Carnegie never forgot it.\nYears later, he made millions by using the same psychology in\nbusiness. For example, he wanted to sell steel rails to the Pennsylvania\nRailroad. J. Edgar Thomson was the president of the Pennsylvania Railroad\nthen. So Andrew Carnegie built a huge steel mill in Pittsburgh and called it\nthe ‘Edgar Thomson Steel Works.’\nHere is a riddle. See if you can guess it. When the Pennsylvania\nRailroad needed steel rails, where do you suppose J. Edgar Thomson\nbought them? . . . From Sears, Roebuck? No. No. You’re wrong. Guess\nagain.\nWhen Carnegie and George Pullman were battling each other for\nsupremacy in the railroad sleeping-car business, the Steel King again\nremembered the lesson of the rabbits.\nThe Central Transportation Company, which Andrew Carnegie\ncontrolled, was fighting with the company that Pullman owned. Both were\nstruggling to get the sleeping-car business of the Union Pacific Railroad,","bucking each other, slashing prices, and destroying all chance of profit.\nBoth Carnegie and Pullman had gone to New York to see the board of\ndirectors of the Union Pacific. Meeting one evening in the St. Nicholas\nHotel, Carnegie said: ‘Good evening, Mr. Pullman, aren’t we making a\ncouple of fools of ourselves?’\n‘What do you mean?’ Pullman demanded.\nThen Carnegie expressed what he had on his mind – a merger of their\ntwo interests. He pictured in glowing terms the mutual advantages of\nworking with, instead of against, each other. Pullman listened attentively,\nbut he was not wholly convinced. Finally he asked, ‘What would you call\nthe new company?’ and Carnegie replied promptly: ‘Why, the Pullman\nPalace Car Company, of course.’\nPullman’s face brightened. ‘Come into my room,’ he said. ‘Let’s talk it\nover.’ That talk made industrial history.\nThis policy of remembering and honouring the names of his friends\nand business associates was one of the secrets of Andrew Carnegie’s\nleadership. He was proud of the fact that he could call many of his factory\nworkers by their first names, and he boasted that while he was personally in\ncharge, no strike ever disturbed his flaming steel mills.\nBenton Love, chairman of Texas Commerce Bancshares, believes that\nthe bigger a corporation gets, the colder it becomes. ‘One way to warm it\nup,’ he said, ‘is to remember people’s names. The executive who tells me\nhe can’t remember names is at the same time telling me he can’t remember\na significant part of his business and is operating on quicksand.’\nKaren Kirsch of Rancho Palos Verdes, California, a flight attendant for\nTWA, made it a practice to learn the names of as many passengers in her\ncabin as possible and use the name when serving them. This resulted in\nmany compliments on her service expressed both to her directly and to the\nairline. One passenger wrote: ‘I haven’t flown TWA for some time, but I’m\ngoing to start flying nothing but TWA from now on. You make me feel that\nyour airline has become a very personalised airline and that is important to\nme.’\nPeople are so proud of their names that they strive to perpetuate them\nat any cost. Even blustering, hard-boiled old P.T. Barnum, the greatest\nshowman of his time, disappointed because he had no sons to carry on his\nname, offered his grandson, C.H. Seeley, $25,000 dollars if he would call\nhimself ‘Barnum’ Seeley.","For many centuries, nobles and magnates supported artists, musicians\nand authors so that their creative works would be dedicated to them.\nLibraries and museums owe their richest collections to people who\ncannot bear to think that their names might perish from the memory of the\nrace. The New York Public Library has its Astor and Lenox collections. The\nMetropolitan Museum perpetuates the names of Benjamin Altman and J.P.\nMorgan. And nearly every church is beautified by stained-glass windows\ncommemorating the names of their donors. Many of the buildings on the\ncampus of most universities bear the names of donors who contributed large\nsums of money for this honour.\nMost people don’t remember names, for the simple reason that they\ndon’t take the time and energy necessary to concentrate and repeat and fix\nnames indelibly in their minds. They make excuses for themselves; they are\ntoo busy.\nBut they were probably no busier than Franklin D. Roosevelt, and he\ntook time to remember and recall even the names of mechanics with whom\nhe came into contact.\nTo illustrate: The Chrysler organisation built a special car for Mr.\nRoosevelt, who could not use a standard car because his legs were\nparalysed. W.F. Chamberlain and a mechanic delivered it to the White\nHouse. I have in front of me a letter from Mr. Chamberlain relating his\nexperiences. ‘I taught President Roosevelt how to handle a car with a lot of\nunusual gadgets, but he taught me a lot about the fine art of handling\npeople.\n‘When I called at the White House,’ Mr. Chamberlain writes, ‘the\nPresident was extremely pleasant and cheerful. He called me by name,\nmade me feel very comfortable, and particularly impressed me with the fact\nthat he was vitally interested in things I had to show him and tell him. The\ncar was so designed that it could be operated entirely by hand. A crowd\ngathered around to look at the car; and he remarked: “I think it is\nmarvellous. All you have to do is to touch a button and it moves away and\nyou can drive it without effort. I think it is grand – I don’t know what\nmakes it go. I’d love to have the time to tear it down and see how it works.”\n‘When Roosevelt’s friends and associates admired the machine, he\nsaid in their presence: “Mr. Chamberlain, I certainly appreciate all the time\nand effort you have spent in developing this car. It is a mighty fine job.” He\nadmired the radiator, the special rear-vision mirror and clock, the special","spotlight, the kind of upholstery, the sitting position of the driver’s seat, the\nspecial suitcases in the trunk with his monogram on each suitcase. In other\nwords, he took notice of every detail to which he knew I had given\nconsiderable thought. He made a point of bringing these various pieces of\nequipment to the attention of Mrs. Roosevelt, Miss Perkins, the Secretary of\nLabour, and his secretary. He even brought the old White House porter into\nthe picture by saying, “George, you want to take particularly good care of\nthe suitcases.”\n‘When the driving lesson was finished, the President turned to me and\nsaid: “Well, Mr. Chamberlain, I have been keeping the Federal Reserve\nBoard waiting thirty minutes. I guess I had better get back to work.”\n‘I took a mechanic with me to the White House. He was introduced to\nRoosevelt when he arrived. He didn’t talk to the President, and Roosevelt\nheard his name only once. He was a shy chap, and he kept in the\nbackground. But before leaving us, the President looked for the mechanic,\nshook his hand, called him by name, and thanked him for coming to\nWashington. And there was nothing perfunctory about his thanks. He meant\nwhat he said. I could feel that.\n‘A few days after returning to New York, I got an autographed\nphotograph of President Roosevelt and a little note of thanks again\nexpressing his appreciation for my assistance. How he found time to do it is\na mystery to me.’\nFranklin D. Roosevelt knew that one of the simplest, most obvious and\nmost important ways of gaining good will was by remembering names and\nmaking people feel important – yet how many of us do it?\nHalf the time we are introduced to a stranger, we chat a few minutes\nand can’t even remember his or her name by the time we say goodbye.\nOne of the first lessons a politician learns is this: ‘To recall a voter’s\nname is statesmanship. To forget it is oblivion.’\nAnd the ability to remember names is almost as important in business\nand social contacts as it is in politics.\nNapoleon the Third, Emperor of France and nephew of the great\nNapoleon, boasted that in spite of all his royal duties he could remember the\nname of every person he met.\nHis technique? Simple. If he didn’t hear the name distinctly, he said,\n‘So sorry. I didn’t get the name clearly.’ Then, if it was an unusual name, he\nwould say, ‘How is it spelled?’","During the conversation, he took the trouble to repeat the name several\ntimes, and tried to associate it in his mind with the person’s features,\nexpression and general appearance.\nIf the person was someone of importance, Napoleon went to even\nfurther pains. As soon as His Royal Highness was alone, he wrote the name\ndown on a piece of paper, looked at it, concentrated on it, fixed it securely\nin his mind, and then tore up the paper. In this way, he gained an eye\nimpression of the name as well as an ear impression.\nAll this takes time, but ‘Good manners,’ said Emerson, ‘are made up\nof petty sacrifices.’\nThe importance of remembering and using names is not just the\nprerogative of kings and corporate executives. It works for all of us. Ken\nNottingham, an employee of General Motors in Indiana, usually had lunch\nat the company cafeteria. He noticed that the woman who worked behind\nthe counter always had a scowl on her face. ‘She had been making\nsandwiches for about two hours and I was just another sandwich to her. I\ntold her what I wanted. She weighed out the ham on a little scale, then she\ngave me one leaf of lettuce, a few potato chips and handed them to me.\n‘The next day I went through the same line. Same woman, same scowl.\nI smiled and said, “Hello, Eunice,” and then told her what I wanted. Well,\nshe forgot the scale, piled on the ham, gave me three leaves of lettuce and\nheaped on the potato chips until they fell off the plate.’\nWe should be aware of the magic contained in a name and realise that\nthis single item is wholly and completely owned by the person with whom\nwe are dealing . . . and nobody else.\nThe name sets the individual apart; it makes him or her unique among\nall others. The information we are imparting or the request we are making\ntakes on a special importance when we approach the situation with the\nname of the individual. From the waitress to the senior executive, the name\nwill work magic as we deal with others.\nPRINCIPLE 3\nRemember that a person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most\nimportant sound in any language.","SOME TIME AGO, I attended a bridge party. I don’t play bridge – and there\nwas a woman there who didn’t play bridge either. She had discovered that I\nhad once been Lowell Thomas’s manager before he went on the radio and\nthat I had travelled in Europe a great deal while helping him prepare the\nillustrated travel talks he was then delivering. So she said: ‘Oh, Mr.\nCarnegie, I do want you to tell me about all the wonderful places you have\nvisited and the sights you have seen.’\nAs we sat down on the sofa, she remarked that she and her husband\nhad recently returned from a trip to Africa. ‘Africa!’ I exclaimed. ‘How\ninteresting! I’ve always wanted to see Africa, but I never got there except\nfor a twenty-four-hour stay once in Algiers. Tell me, did you visit the big-\ngame country? Yes? How fortunate. I envy you. Do tell me about Africa.’\nThat kept her talking for forty-five minutes. She never again asked me\nwhere I had been or what I had seen. She didn’t want to hear me talk about\nmy travels. All she wanted was an interested listener, so she could expand\nher ego and tell about where she had been.\nWas she unusual? No. Many people are like that.\nFor example, I met a distinguished botanist at a dinner party given by a\nNew York book publisher. I had never talked with a botanist before, and I\nfound him fascinating. I literally sat on the edge of my chair and listened\nwhile he spoke of exotic plants and experiments in developing new forms\nof plant life and indoor gardens (and even told me astonishing facts about\nthe humble potato). I had a small indoor garden of my own – and he was\ngood enough to tell me how to solve some of my problems.\nAs I said, we were at a dinner party. There must have been a dozen\nother guests, but I violated all the canons of courtesy, ignored everyone\nelse, and talked for hours to the botanist.\nMidnight came. I said good night to everyone and departed. The\nbotanist then turned to our host and paid me several flattering compliments.","I was ‘most stimulating.’ I was this and I was that, and he ended by saying I\nwas a ‘most interesting conversationalist.’\nAn interesting conversationalist? Why, I had said hardly anything at\nall. I couldn’t have said anything if I had wanted to without changing the\nsubject, for I didn’t know any more about botany than I knew about the\nanatomy of a penguin. But I had done this: I had listened intently. I had\nlistened because I was genuinely interested. And he felt it. Naturally that\npleased him. That kind of listening is one of the highest compliments we\ncan pay anyone. ‘Few human beings,’ wrote Jack Woodford in Strangers in\nLove, ‘few human beings are proof against the implied flattery of rapt\nattention.’ I went even further than giving him rapt attention. I was ‘hearty\nin my approbation and lavish in my praise.’\nI told him that I had been immensely entertained and instructed – and I\nhad. I told him I wished I had his knowledge – and I did. I told him that I\nshould love to wander the fields with him – and I have. I told him I must\nsee him again – and I did.\nAnd so I had him thinking of me as a good conversationalist when, in\nreality, I had been merely a good listener and had encouraged him to talk.\nWhat is the secret, the mystery, of a successful business interview?\nWell, according to former Harvard president Charles W. Eliot, ‘There is no\nmystery about successful business intercourse . . . Exclusive attention to the\nperson who is speaking to you is very important. Nothing else is so\nflattering as that.’\nEliot himself was a past master of the art of listening. Henry James,\none of America’s first great novelists, recalled: ‘Dr. Eliot’s listening was not\nmere silence, but a form of activity. Sitting very erect on the end of his\nspine with hands joined in his lap, making no movement except that he\nrevolved his thumbs around each other faster or slower, he faced his\ninterlocutor and seemed to be hearing with his eyes as well as his ears. He\nlistened with his mind and attentively considered what you had to say while\nyou said it . . . At the end of an interview the person who had talked to him\nfelt that he had had his say.’\nSelf-evident, isn’t it? You don’t have to study for four years in Harvard\nto discover that. Yet I know and you know department store owners who\nwill rent expensive space, buy their goods economically, dress their\nwindows appealingly, spend thousands of dollars in advertising and then\nhire clerks who haven’t the sense to be good listeners – clerks who interrupt","customers, contradict them, irritate them, and all but drive them from the\nstore.\nA department store in Chicago almost lost a regular customer who\nspent several thousand dollars each year in that store because a sales clerk\nwouldn’t listen. Mrs Henrietta Douglas, who took our course in Chicago,\nhad purchased a coat at a special sale. After she had brought it home she\nnoticed that there was a tear in the lining. She came back the next day and\nasked the sales clerk to exchange it. The clerk refused even to listen to her\ncomplaint. ‘You bought this at a special sale,’ she said. She pointed to a\nsign on the wall. ‘Read that,’ she exclaimed. ‘“All sales are final.” Once\nyou bought it, you have to keep it. Sew up the lining yourself.’\n‘But this was damaged merchandise,’ Mrs Douglas complained.\n‘Makes no difference,’ the clerk interrupted. ‘Final’s final.’\nMrs Douglas was about to walk out indignantly, swearing never to\nreturn to that store ever, when she was greeted by the department manager,\nwho knew her from her many years of patronage. Mrs Douglas told her\nwhat had happened.\nThe manager listened attentively to the whole story, examined the coat\nand then said: ‘Special sales are “final” so we can dispose of merchandise at\nthe end of the season. But this “no return” policy does not apply to damaged\ngoods. We will certainly repair or replace the lining, or if you prefer, give\nyou your money back.’\nWhat a difference in treatment! If that manager had not come along\nand listened to the customer, a long-term patron of that store could have\nbeen lost forever.\nListening is just as important in one’s home life as in the world of\nbusiness. Millie Esposito of Croton-on-Hudson, New York, made it her\nbusiness to listen carefully when one of her children wanted to speak with\nher. One evening she was sitting in the kitchen with her son, Robert, and\nafter a brief discussion of something that was on his mind, Robert said:\n‘Mom, I know that you love me very much.’\nMrs. Esposito was touched and said: ‘Of course I love you very much.\nDid you doubt it?’\nRobert responded: ‘No, but I really know you love me because\nwhenever I want to talk to you about something you stop whatever you are\ndoing and listen to me.’","The chronic kicker, even the most violent critic, will frequently soften\nand be subdued in the presence of a patient, sympathetic listener – a listener\nwho will be silent while the irate fault-finder dilates like a king cobra and\nspews the poison out of his system. To illustrate: The New York Telephone\nCompany discovered a few years ago that it had to deal with one of the\nmost vicious customers who ever cursed a customer service representative.\nAnd he did curse. He raved. He threatened to tear the phone out by its roots.\nHe refused to pay certain charges that he declared were false. He wrote\nletters to the newspapers. He filed innumerable complaints with the Public\nService Commission, and he started several suits against the telephone\ncompany.\nAt last, one of the company’s most skilful ‘troubleshooters’ was sent to\ninterview this stormy petrel. This ‘trouble-shooter’ listened and let the\ncantakerous customer enjoy himself pouring out his tirade. The telephone\nrepresentative listened and said ‘yes’ and sympathised with his grievance.\n‘He raved on and I listened for nearly three hours,’ the ‘troubleshooter’\nsaid as he related his experiences before one of the author’s classes. ‘Then I\nwent back and listened some more. I interviewed him four times, and before\nthe fourth visit was over I had become a charter member of an organisation\nhe was starting. He called it the “Telephone Subscribers” Protective\nAssociation.’ I am still a member of this organisation, and, so far as I know,\nI’m the only member in the world today besides Mr. –.\n‘I listened and sympathised with him on every point that he had made\nduring these interviews. He had never had a telephone representative talk\nwith him that way before, and he became almost friendly. The point on\nwhich I went to see him was not even mentioned on the first visit, nor was it\nmentioned on the second or third, but upon the fourth interview, I closed the\ncase completely, he paid all his bills in full, and for the first time in the\nhistory of his difficulties with the telephone company he voluntarily\nwithdrew his complaints from the Public Service Commission.’\nDoubtless Mr. – had considered himself a holy crusader, defending the\npublic rights against callous exploitation. But in reality, what he had really\nwanted was a feeling of importance. He got this feeling of importance at\nfirst by kicking and complaining. But as soon as he got his feeling of\nimportance from a representative of the company, his imagined grievances\nvanished into thin air.","One morning years ago, an angry customer stormed into the office of\nJulian F. Detmer, founder of the Detmer Woollen Company, which later\nbecame the world’s largest distributor of woollens to the tailoring trade.\n‘This man owed us a small sum of money,’ Mr. Detmer explained to\nme. ‘The customer denied it, but we knew he was wrong. So our credit\ndepartment had insisted that he pay. After getting a number of letters from\nour credit department, he packed his grip, made a trip to Chicago, and\nhurried into my office to inform me not only that he was not going to pay\nthat bill, but that he was never going to buy another dollar’s worth of goods\nfrom the Detmer Woollen Company.\n‘I listened patiently to all he had to say. I was tempted to interrupt, but\nI realised that would be bad policy. So I let him talk himself out. When he\nfinally simmered down and got in a receptive mood, I said quietly: “I want\nto thank you for coming to Chicago to tell me about this. You have done me\na great favour, for if our credit department has annoyed you, it may annoy\nother good customers, and that would be just too bad. Believe me, I am far\nmore eager to hear this than you are to tell it.”\n‘That was the last thing in the world he expected me to say. I think he\nwas a trifle disappointed, because he had come to Chicago to tell me a thing\nor two, but here I was thanking him instead of scrapping with him. I assured\nhim we would wipe the charge off the books and forget it, because he was a\nvery careful man with only one account to look after, while our clerks had\nto look after thousands. Therefore, he was less likely to be wrong than we\nwere.\n‘I told him that I understood exactly how he felt and that, if I were in\nhis shoes, I should undoubtedly feel precisely as he did. Since he wasn’t\ngoing to buy from us anymore, I recommended some other woollen houses.\n‘In the past, we had usually lunched together when he came to\nChicago, so I invited him to have lunch with me this day. He accepted\nreluctantly, but when we came back to the office he placed a larger order\nthan ever before. He returned home in a softened mood and, wanting to be\njust as fair with us as we had been with him, looked over his bills, found\none had been mislaid, and sent us a cheque with his apologies.\n‘Later, when his wife presented him with a baby boy, he gave his son\nthe middle name of Detmer, and he remained a friend and customer of the\nhouse until his death twenty-two years afterwards.’","Years ago, a poor Dutch immigrant boy washed the windows of a\nbakery shop after school to help support his family. His people were so poor\nthat in addition he used to go out in the street with a basket every day and\ncollect stray bits of coal that had fallen in the gutter where the coal wagons\nhad delivered fuel. That boy, Edward Bok, never got more than six years of\nschooling in his life; yet eventually he made himself one of the most\nsuccessful magazine editors in the history of American journalism. How did\nhe do it? That is a long story, but how he got his start can be told briefly. He\ngot his start by using the principles in this chapter.\nHe left school when he was thirteen, and became an office boy for\nWestern Union, but he didn’t for one moment give up the idea of an\neducation. Instead, he started to educate himself. He saved his carfares and\nwent without lunch until he had enough money to buy an encyclopedia of\nAmerican biography – and then he did an unheard-of thing. He read the\nlives of famous people and wrote them asking for additional information\nabout their childhoods. He was a good listener. He asked famous people to\ntell him more about themselves. He wrote General James A. Garfield, who\nwas then running for President, and asked if it was true that he was once a\ntow boy on a canal; and Garfield replied. He wrote General Grant asking\nabout a certain battle, and Grant drew a map for him and invited this\nfourteen-year-old boy to dinner and spent the evening talking to him.\nSoon our Western Union messenger boy was corresponding with many\nof the most famous people in the nation: Ralph Waldo Emerson, Oliver\nWendell Holmes, Longfellow, Mrs. Abraham Lincoln, Louisa May Alcott,\nGeneral Sherman and Jefferson Davis. Not only did he correspond with\nthese distinguished people, but as soon as he got a vacation, he visited many\nof them as a welcome guest in their homes. This experience imbued him\nwith a confidence that was invaluable. These men and women fired him\nwith a vision and ambition that shaped his life. And all this, let me repeat,\nwas made possible solely by the application of the principles we are\ndiscussing here.\nIsaac F. Marcosson, a journalist who interviewed hundreds of\ncelebrities, declared that many people fail to make a favourable impression\nbecause they don’t listen attentively. ‘They have been so much concerned\nwith what they are going to say next that they do not keep their ears open . .\n. Very important people have told me that they prefer good listeners to good","talkers, but the ability to listen seems rarer than almost any other good\ntrait.’\nAnd not only important personages crave a good listener, but ordinary\nfolk do too. As the Readers’s Digest once said: ‘Many persons call a doctor\nwhen all they want is an audience.’\nDuring the darkest hours of the Civil War, Lincoln wrote to an old\nfriend in Springfield, Illinois, asking him to come to Washington. Lincoln\nsaid he had some problems he wanted to discuss with him. The old\nneighbour called at the White House, and Lincoln talked to him for hours\nabout the advisability of issuing a proclamation freeing the slaves. Lincoln\nwent over all the arguments for and against such a move, and then read\nletters and newspaper articles, some denouncing him for not freeing the\nslaves and others denouncing him for fear he was going to free them. After\ntalking for hours, Lincoln shook hands with his old neighbour, said good\nnight, and sent him back to Illinois without even asking for his opinion.\nLincoln had done all the talking himself. That seemed to clarify his mind.\n‘He seemed to feel easier after that talk,’ the old friend said. Lincoln hadn’t\nwanted advice. He had wanted merely a friendly, sympathetic listener to\nwhom he could unburden himself. That’s what we all want when we are in\ntrouble. That is frequently all the irritated customer wants, and the\ndissatisfied employee or the hurt friend.\nOne of the great listeners of modern times was Sigmund Freud. A man\nwho met Freud described his manner of listening. ‘It struck me so forcibly\nthat I shall never forget him. He had qualities which I had never seen in any\nother man. Never had I seen such concentrated attention. There was none of\nthe piercing “soul penetrating gaze” business. His eyes were mild and\ngenial. His voice was low and kind. His gestures were few. But the attention\nhe gave me, his appreciation of what I said, even when I said it badly, was\nextraordinary. You’ve no idea what it meant to be listened to like that.’\nIf you want to know how to make people shun you and laugh at you\nbehind your back and even despise you, here is the recipe: Never listen to\nanyone for long. Talk incessantly about yourself. If you have an idea while\nthe other person is talking, don’t wait for him or her to finish: bust right in\nand interrupt in the middle of a sentance.\nDo you know people like that? I do, unfortunately; and the astonishing\npart of it is that some of them are prominent.","Bores, that is all they are – bores intoxicated with their own egos,\ndrunk with a sense of their own importance.\nPeople who talk only of themselves think only of themselves. And\n‘those people who think only of themselves,’ Dr. Nicholas Murray Butley,\nlongtime president of Columbia University, said, ‘are hopelessly\nuneducated. They are not educated,’ said Dr. Butler, ‘no matter how\ninstructed they may be.’\nSo if you aspire to be a good conversationalist, be an attentive listener.\nTo be interesting, be interested. Ask questions that other persons will enjoy\nanswering. Encourage them to talk about themselves and their\naccomplishments.\nRemember that the people you are talking to are a hundred times more\nintested in themselves and their wants and problems than they are in you\nand your problems. A person’s toothache means more to that person than a\nfamine in China which kills a million people. A boil on one’s neck interests\none more than forty earthquakes in Africa. Think of that the next time you\nstart a conversation.\nPRINCIPLE 4\nBe a good listener.\nEncourage others to talk about themselves.","EVERYONE WHO WAS ever a guest of Theodore Roosevelt was astonished at\nthe range and diversity of his knowledge. Whether his visitor was a cowboy\nor a Rough Rider, a New York politician or a diplomat, Roosevelt knew\nwhat to say. And how was it done? The answer was simple. Whenever\nRoosevelt expected a visitor, he sat up late the night before, reading up on\nthe subject in which he knew his guest was particularly interested.\nFor Roosevelt knew, as all leaders know, that the royal road to a\nperson’s heart is to talk about the things he or she treasures most.\nThe genial William Lyon Phelps, essayist and professor of literature at\nYale, learned this lesson early in life.\n‘When I was eight years old and was spending a weekend visiting my\nAunt Libby Linsley at her home in Stratford on the Housatonic,’ he wrote\nin his essay on Human Nature, ‘a middle-aged man called one evening, and\nafter a polite skirmish with my aunt, he devoted his attention to me. At that\ntime, I happened to be excited about boats, and the visitor discussed the\nsubject in a way that seemed particularly interesting. After he left, I spoke\nof him with enthusiasm. What a man! My aunt informed me he was a New\nYork lawyer, that he cared nothing whatever about boats – that he took not\nthe slightest interest in the subject. “But why then did he talk all the time\nabout boats?”\n‘ “Because he is a gentleman. He saw you were interested in boats, and\nhe talked about the things he knew would interest and please you. He made\nhimself agreeable.”’\nAnd William Lyon Phelps added: ‘I never forgot my aunt’s remark.’\nAs I write this chapter, I have before me a letter from Edward L.\nChalif, who was active in Boy Scout work.\n‘One day I found I needed a favor,’ wrote Mr. Chalif. ‘A big Scout\njamboree was coming off in Europe, and I wanted the president of one of\nthe largest corporations in America to pay the expenses of one of my boys\nfor the trip.","‘Fortunately, just before I went to see this man, I heard that he had\ndrawn a cheque for a million dollars, and that after it was cancelled, he had\nit framed.\n‘So the first thing I did when I entered his office was to ask to see the\ncheque. A cheque for a million dollars! I told him I never knew that\nanybody had ever written such a cheque, and that I wanted to tell my boys\nthat I had actually seen a cheque for a million dollars. He gladly showed it\nto me; I admired it and asked him to tell me all about how it happened to be\ndrawn.’\nYou notice, don’t you, that Mr. Chalif didn’t begin by talking about the\nBoy Scouts, or the jamboree in Europe, or what it was he wanted? He\ntalked in terms of what interested the other man. Here’s the result:\n‘Presently, the man I was interviewing said: “Oh, by the way, what was\nit you wanted to see me about?” So I told him.\n‘To my vast surprise,’ Mr. Chalif continues, ‘he not only granted\nimmediately what I asked for, but much more. I had asked him to send only\none boy to Europe, but he sent five boys and myself, gave me a letter of\ncredit for a thousand dollars and told us to stay in Europe for seven weeks.\nHe also gave me letters of introduction to his branch presidents, putting\nthem at our service, and he himself met us in Paris and showed us the town.\nSince then, he has given jobs to some of the boys whose parents were in\nwant, and he is still active in our group.\n‘Yet I know if I hadn’t found out what he was interested in, and got\nhim warmed up first, I wouldn’t have found him one-tenth as easy to\napproach.’\nIs this a valuable technique to use in business? Is it? Let’s see. Take\nHenry G. Duvernoy of Duvernoy and Sons, a wholesale baking firm in New\nYork.\nMr. Duvernoy had been trying to sell bread to a certain New York\nhotel. He had called on the manager every week for four years. He went to\nthe same social affairs the manager attended. He even took rooms in the\nhotel and lived there in order to get the business. But he failed.\n‘Then,’ said Mr. Duvernoy, ‘after studying human relations, I resolved\nto change my tactics. I decided to find out what interested this man – what\ncaught his enthusiasm.\n‘I discovered he belonged to a society of hotel executives called the\nHotel Greeters of America. He not only belonged, but his bubbling","enthusiasm had made him president of the organisation, and the president of\nthe International Greeters. No matter where its conventions were held, he\nwould be there.\n‘So when I saw him the next day, I began talking about the Greeters.\nWhat a response I got. What a response! He talked to me for half an hour\nabout the Greeters, his tones vibrant with enthusiasm. I could plainly see\nthat this society was not only his hobby, it was the passion of his life.\nBefore I left his office, he had “sold” me a membership in his organisation.\n‘In the meantime, I had said nothing about bread. But a few days later,\nthe steward of his hotel phoned me to come over with samples and prices.\n‘ “I don’t know what you did to the old boy,” the steward greeted me,\n“but he sure is sold on you!”\n‘Think of it! I had been drumming at that man for four years – trying\nto get his business – and I’d still be drumming at him if I hadn’t finally\ntaken the trouble to find out what he was interested in, and what he enjoyed\ntalking about.’\nEdward E. Harriman of Hagerstown, Maryland, chose to live in the\nbeautiful Cumberland valley of Maryland after he completed his military\nservice. Unfortunately, at that time there were few jobs available in the area.\nA little research uncovered the fact that a number of companies in the area\nwere either owned or controlled by an unusual business maverick, R.J.\nFunkhouser, whose rise from poverty to riches intrigued Mr. Harriman.\nHowever, he was known for being inaccessible to job seekers. Mr.\nHarriman wrote:\n‘I interviewed a number of people and found that his major interest\nwas anchored in his drive for power and money. Since he protected himself\nfrom people like me by use of a dedicated and stern secretary, I studied her\ninterests and goals and only then I paid an unannounced visit at her office.\nShe had been Mr. Funkhouser’s orbiting satellite for about fifteen years.\nWhen I told her I had a proposition for him which might translate itself into\nfinancial and political success for him, she became enthused. I also\nconversed with her about her constructive participation in his success. After\nthis conversation she arranged for me to meet Mr. Funkhouser.\n‘I entered his huge and impressive office determined not to ask directly\nfor a job. He was seated behind a large carved desk and thundered at me,\n“How about it, young man?” I said, “Mr. Funkhouser, I believe I can make\nmoney for you.” He immediately rose and invited me to sit in one of the","large upholstered chairs. I enumerated my ideas and the qualifications I had\nto realise these ideas, as well as how they would contribute to his personal\nsuccess and that of his businesses.\n‘ “R.J.,” as he became known to me, hired me at once and for over\ntwenty years I have grown in his enterprises and we both have prospered.’\nTalking in terms of the other person’s interests pays off for both\nparties. Howard Z. Herzig, a leader in the field of employee\ncommunications, has always followed this principle. When asked what\nreward he got from it, Mr. Herzig responded that he not only received a\ndifferent reward from each person but that in general the reward had been\nan enlargement of his life each time he spoke to someone.\nPRINCIPLE 5\nTalk in terms of the other person’s interests.","I WAS WAITING in line to register a letter in the post office at Thirty-third\nStreet and Eighth Avenue in New York. I noticed that the clerk appeared to\nbe bored with the job – weighing envelopes, handing out stamps, making\nchange, issuing receipts – the same monotonous grind year after year. So I\nsaid to myself: ‘I am going to try to make that clerk like me. Obviously to\nmake him like me, I must say something nice, not about myself, but about\nhim. So I asked myself, “What is there about him that I can honestly\nadmire?” ’ That is sometimes a hard question to answer, especially with\nstrangers; but, in this case, it happened to be easy. I instantly saw something\nI admired no end.\nSo while he was weighing my envelope, I remarked with enthusiasm: I\nwish I had your head of hair.’\nHe looked up, half-startled, his face beaming with smiles. ‘Well, it\nisn’t as good as it used to be,’ he said modestly. I assured him that although\nit might have lost some of its pristine glory, nevertheless it was still\nmagnificent. He was immensely pleased. We carried on a pleasant little\nconversation and the last thing he said to me was: ‘Many people have\nadmired my hair.’\nI’ll bet that person went to lunch that day walking on air. I’ll bet he\nwent home that night and told his wife about it. I’ll bet he looked in the\nmirror and said: ‘It is a beautiful head of hair.’\nI told this story once in public and a man asked me afterwards: ‘What\ndid you want to get out of him?’\nWhat was I trying to get out of him!!! What was I trying to get out of\nhim!!!\nIf we are so contemptibly selfish that we can’t radiate a little happiness\nand pass on a bit of honest appreciation without trying to get something out\nof the other person in return – if our souls are no bigger than sour crab\napples, we shall meet with the failure we so richly deserve.","Oh yes, I did want something out of that chap. I wanted something\npriceless. And I got it. I got the feeling that I had done something for him\nwithout his being able to do anything whatever in return for me. That is a\nfeeling that flows and sings in your memory long after the incident is past.\nThere is one all-important law of human conduct. If we obey that law,\nwe shall almost never get into trouble. In fact, that law, if obeyed, will bring\nus countless friends and constant happiness. But the very instant we break\nthe law, we shall get into endless trouble. The law is this: Always make the\nother person feel important. John Dewey, as we have already noted, said\nthat the desire to be important is the deepest urge in human nature; and\nWilliam James said: ‘The deepest principle in human nature is the craving\nto be appreciated.’ As I have already pointed out, it is this urge that\ndifferentiates us from the animals. It is this urge that has been responsible\nfor civilisation itself.\nPhilosophers have been speculating on the rules of human\nrelationships for thousands of years, and out of all that speculation, there\nhas evolved only one important precept. It is not new. It is as old as history.\nZoroaster taught it to his followers in Persia twenty-five hundred years ago.\nConfucius preached it in China twenty-four centuries ago. Lao-tse, the\nfounder of Taoism, taught it to his disciples in the Valley of the Han.\nBuddha preached it on the bank of the Holy Ganges five hundred years\nbefore Christ. The sacred books of Hinduism taught it among the stony hills\nof Judea nineteen centuries ago. Jesus summed it up in one thought –\nprobably the most important rule in the world: ‘Do unto others as you\nwould have others do unto you.’\nYou want the approval of those with whom you come in contact. You\nwant recognition of your true worth. You want a feeling that you are\nimportant in your little world. You don’t want to listen to cheap, insincere\nflattery, but you do crave sincere appreciation. You want your friends and\nassociates to be, as Charles Schwab put it, ‘hearty in their approbation and\nlavish in their praise.’ All of us want that.\nSo let’s obey the Golden Rule, and give unto others what we would\nhave others give unto us.\nHow? When? Where? The answer is: All the time, everywhere.\nDavid G. Smith of Eau Claire, Wisconsin, told one of our classes how\nhe handled a delicate situation when he was asked to take charge of the\nrefreshment booth at a charity concert.","‘The night of the concert I arrived at the park and found two elderly\nladies in a very bad humour standing next to the refreshment stand.\nApparently each thought that she was in charge of this project. As I stood\nthere pondering what to do, one of the members of the sponsoring\ncommittee appeared and handed me a cash box and thanked me for taking\nover the project, She introduced Rose and Jane as my helpers and then ran\noff.\n‘A great silence ensued. Realising that the cash box was a symbol of\nauthority (of sorts), I gave the box to Rose and explained that I might not be\nable to keep the money straight and that if she took care of it I would feel\nbetter. I then suggested to Jane that she show two teenagers who had been\nassigned to refreshments how to operate the soda machine, and asked her to\nbe responsible for that part of the project.\n‘The whole evening was very enjoyable with Rose happily counting\nthe money, Jane supervising the teenagers, and me enjoying the concert.’\nYou don’t have to wait until you are ambassador to France or chairman\nof the Clambake Committee of your lodge before you use this philosophy\nof appreciation. You can work magic with it almost every day.\nIf, for example, the waitress brings us mashed potatoes when we have\nordered French fried, let’s say, ‘I’m sorry to trouble you, but I prefer the\nFrench fried.’ She’ll probably reply, ‘No trouble at all’ and will be glad to\nchange the potatoes, because we have shown respect for her.\nLittle phrases such as ‘I’m sorry to trouble you,’ ‘Would you be so\nkind as to – ?’ ‘Won’t you please?’ ‘Would you mind?’ ‘Thank you’ – little\ncourtesies like these oil the cogs of the monotonous grind of everyday life –\nand incidentally, they are the hallmark of good breeding.\nLet’s take another illustration. Hall Caine’s novels – The Christian,\nThe Deemster, The Manxman, among them – were all best-sellers in the\nearly part of this century [20th]. Millions of people read his novels,\ncountless millions. He was the son of a blacksmith. He never had more than\neight years’ schooling in his life; yet when he died he was the richest\nliterary man of his time.\nThe story goes like this: Hall Gaine loved sonnets and ballads; so he\ndevoured all of Dante Gabriel Rossetti’s poetry. He even wrote a lecture\nchanting the praises of Rossetti’s artistic achievement – and sent a copy to\nRossetti himself. Rossetti was delighted. ‘Any young man who has such an\nexalted opinion of my ability,’ Rossetti probably said to himself, ‘must be","brilliant.’ So Rossetti invited this blacksmith’s son to come to London and\nact as his secretary. That was the turning point in Hall Caine’s life; for, in\nhis new position, he met the literary artists of the day. Profiting by their\nadvice and inspired by their encouragement, he launched upon a career that\nemblazoned his name across the sky.\nHis home, Greeba Castle, on the Isle of Man, became a Mecca for\ntourists from the far corners of the world, and he left a multimillion dollar\nestate. Yet – who knows – he might have died poor and unknown had he not\nwritten an essay expressing his admiration for a famous man.\nSuch is the power, the stupendous power, of sincere heart-felt\nappreciation.\nRossetti considered himself important. That is not strange. Almost\neveryone considers himself important, very important.\nThe life of many a person could probably be changed if only someone\nwould make him feel important. Ronald J. Rowland, who is one of the\ninstructors of our course in California, is also a teacher of arts and crafts.\nHe wrote to us about a student named Chris in his beginning-crafts class:\nChris was a very quiet, shy boy lacking in self-confidence, the\nkind of student that often does not receive the attention he\ndeserves. I also teach an advanced class that had grown to be\nsomewhat of a status symbol and a privilege for a student to have\nearned the right to be in it.\nOn Wednesday, Chris was diligently working at his desk. I\nreally felt there was a hidden fire deep inside him. I asked Chris if\nhe would like to be in the advanced class. How I wish I could\nexpress the look in Chris’s face, the emotions in that shy fourteen-\nyear-old boy, trying to hold back his tears.\n‘Who me, Mr. Rowland? Am I good enough?’\n‘Yes, Chris, you are good enough.’\nI had to leave at that point because tears were coming to my\neyes. As Chris walked out of class that day, seemingly two inches\ntaller, he looked at me with bright blue eyes and said in a positive\nvoice, ‘Thank you, Mr. Rowland.’\nChris taught me a lesson I will never forget – our deep desire\nto feel important. To help me never forget this rule, I made a sign\nwhich reads ‘YOU ARE IMPORTANT.’ This sign hangs in the","front of the classroom for all to see and to remind me that each\nstudent I face is equally important.\nThe unvarnished truth is that almost all the people you meet feel themselves\nsuperior to you in some way, and a sure way to their hearts is to let them\nrealise in some subtle way that you realise their importance, and recognise\nit sincerely.\nRemember what Emerson said: ‘Every man I meet is my superior in\nsome way. In that, I learn of him.’\nAnd the pathetic part of it is that frequently those who have the least\njustification for a feeling of achievement bolster up their egos by a show of\ntumult and conceit which is truly nauseating. As Shakespeare put it: ‘. . .\nman, proud man,/Drest in a little brief authority,/ . . . Plays such fantastic\ntricks before high heaven/As make the angels weep.’\nI am going to tell you how business people in my own courses have\napplied these principles with remarkable results. Let’s take the case of a\nConnecticut attorney (because of his relatives he prefers not to have his\nname mentioned).\nShortly after joining the course, Mr. R – drove to Long Island with his\nwife to visit some of her relatives. She left him to chat with an old aunt of\nhers and then rushed off by herself to visit some of the younger relatives.\nSince he soon had to give a speech professionally on how he applied the\nprinciples of appreciation, he thought he would gain some worthwhile\nexperience talking with the elderly lady. So he looked around the house to\nsee what he could honestly admire.\n‘This house was built about 1890, wasn’t it?’ he inquired.\n‘Yes,’ she replied, ‘that is precisely the year it was built.’\n‘It reminds me of the house I was born in,’ he said. ‘It’s beautiful. Well\nbuilt. Roomy. You know, they don’t build houses like this anymore.’\n‘You’re right,’ the old lady agreed. ‘The young folks nowadays don’t\ncare for beautiful homes. All they want is a small apartment, and then they\ngo gadding about in their automobiles.\n‘This is a dream house,’ she said in a voice vibrating with tender\nmemories. ‘This house was built with love. My husband and I dreamed\nabout it for years before we built it. We didn’t have an architect. We\nplanned it all ouselves.’","She showed Mr. R – about the house, and he expressed his hearty\nadmiration for the beautiful treasures she had picked up in her travels and\ncherished over a lifetime – paisley shawls, an old English tea set,\nWedgwood china, French beds and chairs, Italian paintings, and silk\ndraperies that had once hung in a French chateau.\nAfter showing Mr. R – through the house, she took him out to the\ngarage. There, jacked up on blocks, was a Packard car – in mint condition.\n‘My husband bought that car for me shortly before he passed on,’ she\nsaid softly. ‘I have never ridden in it since his death . . . You appreciate nice\nthings, and I’m going to give this car to you.’\n‘Why, aunty,’ he said, ‘you overwhelm me. I appreciate your\ngenerosity, of course; but I couldn’t possibly accept it. I’m not even a\nrelative of yours. I have a new car, and you have many relatives that would\nlike to have that Packard.’\n‘Relatives!’ she exclaimed. ‘Yes, I have relatives who are just waiting\ntill I die so they can get that car. But they are not going to get it.’\n‘If you don’t want to give it to them, you can very easily sell it to a\nsecondhand dealer,’ he told her.\n‘Sell it!’ she cried. ‘Do you think I would sell this car? Do you think I\ncould stand to see strangers riding up and down the street in that car – that\ncar that my husband bought for me? I wouldn’t dream of selling it. I’m\ngoing to give it to you. You appreciate beautiful things.’\nHe tried to get out of accepting the car, but he couldn’t without hurting\nher feelings.\nThis lady, left all alone in a big house with her paisley shawls, her\nFrench antiques, and her memories, was starving for a little recognition.\nShe had once been young and beautiful and sought after. She had once built\na house warm with love and had collected things from all over Europe to\nmake it beautiful. Now, in the isolated loneliness of old age, she craved a\nlittle human warmth, a little genuine appreciation – and no one gave it to\nher. And when she found it, like a spring in the desert, her gratitude\ncouldn’t adequately express itself with anything less than the gift of her\ncherished Packard.\nLet’s take another case: Donald M. McMahon, who was\nsuperintendent of Lewis and Valentine, nurserymen and landscape\narchitects in Rye, New York, related this incident:","‘Shortly after I attended the talk on “How to Win Friends and\nInfluence People,” I was landscaping the estate of a famous attorney. The\nowner came out to give me a few instructions about where he wished to\nplant a mass of rhododendrons and azaleas.\n‘I said, “Judge, you have a lovely hobby. I’ve been admiring your\nbeautiful dogs. I understand you win a lot of blue ribbons every year at the\nshow in Madison Square Garden.”\n‘The effect of this little expression of appreciation was striking.\n‘“Yes,” the judge replied, “I do have a lot of fun with my dogs. Would\nyou like to see my kennel?”\n‘He spent almost an hour showing me his dogs and the prizes they had\nwon. He even brought out their pedigrees and explained about the\nbloodlines responsible for such beauty and intelligence.\n‘Finally, turning to me, he asked: “Do you have any small children?”\n‘ “Yes, I do,” I replied, “I have a son.”\n‘ “Well, wouldn’t he like a puppy?’ the judge inquired.\n‘ “Oh, yes, he’d be tickled pink.’\n‘ “All right, I’m going to give him one,” the judge announced.\n‘He started to tell me how to feed the puppy. Then he paused. “You’ll\nforget it if I tell you. I’ll write it out.” So the judge went in the house, typed\nout the pedigree and feeding instructions, and gave me a puppy worth\nseveral hundred dollars and one hour and fifteen minutes of his valuable\ntime largely because I had expressed my honest admiration for his hobby\nand achievements.’\nGeorge Eastman, of Kodak fame, invented the transparent film that\nmade motion pictures possible, amassed a fortune of a hundred million\ndollars, and made himself one of the most famous business men on earth.\nYet in spite of all these tremendous accomplishments, he craved little\nrecognitions even as you and I.\nTo illustrate: When Eastman was building the Eastman School of\nMusic and also Kilbourn Hall in Rochester, James Adamson, then president\nof the Superior Seating Company of New York, wanted to get the order to\nsupply the theatre chairs for these buildings. Phoning the architect, Mr.\nAdamson made an appointment to see Mr. Eastman in Rochester.\nWhen Adamson arrived, the architect said: ‘I know you want to get\nthis order, but I can tell you right now that you won’t stand a ghost of a","show if you take more than five minutes of George Eastman’s time. He is a\nstrict disciplinarian. He is very busy. So tell your story quickly and get out.’\nAdamson was prepared to do just that.\nWhen he was ushered into the room he saw Mr. Eastman bending over\na pile of papers at his desk. Presently, Mr. Eastman looked up, removed his\nglasses, and walked toward the architect and Mr. Adamson, saying: ‘Good\nmorning, gentlemen, what can I do for you?’\nThe architect introduced them, and then Mr. Adamson said: ‘While\nwe’ve been waiting for you, Mr. Eastman, I’ve been admiring your office. I\nwouldn’t mind working in a room like this myself. I’m in the interior-\nwoodworking business, and I never saw a more beautiful office in all my\nlife.’\nGeorge Eastman replied: ‘You remind me of something I had almost\nforgotten. It is beautiful, isn’t it? I enjoyed it a great deal when it was first\nbuilt. But I come down here now with a lot of other things on my mind and\nsometimes don’t even see the room for weeks at a time.’\nAdamson walked over and rubbed his hand across a panel. ‘This is\nEnglish oak, isn’t it? A little different texture from the Italian oak.’\n‘Yes,’ Eastman replied. ‘Imported English oak. It was selected for me\nby a friend who specialises in fine woods.’\nThen Eastman showed him about the room, commenting on the\nproportions, the colouring, the hand carving and other effects he had helped\nto plan and execute.\nWhile drifting about the room, admiring the woodwork, they paused\nbefore a window, and George Eastman, in his modest, soft-spoken way,\npointed out some of the institutions through which he was trying to help\nhumanity: the University of Rochester, the General Hospital, the\nHomeopathic Hospital, the Friendly Home, the Children’s Hospital. Mr.\nAdamson congratulated him warmly on the idealistic way he was using his\nwealth to alleviate the sufferings of humanity. Presently, George Eastman\nunlocked a glass case and pulled out the first camera he had ever owned –\nan invention he had bought from an Englishman.\nAdamson questioned him at length about his early struggles to get\nstarted in business, and Mr. Eastman spoke with real feeling about the\npoverty of his childhood, telling how his widowed mother had kept a\nboardinghouse while he clerked in an insurance office. The terror of poverty\nhaunted him day and night, and he resolved to make enough money so that","his mother wouldn’t have to work. Mr. Adamson drew him out with further\nquestions and listened, absorbed, while he related the story of his\nexperiments with dry photographic plates. He told how he had worked in an\noffice all day, and sometimes experimented all night, taking only brief naps\nwhile the chemicals were working, sometimes working and sleeping in his\nclothes for seventy-two hours at a stretch.\nJames Adamson had been ushered into Eastman’s office at ten-fifteen\nand had been warned that he must not take more than five minutes; but an\nhour had passed, then two hours passed. And they were still talking.\nFinally, George Eastman turned to Adamson and said, ‘The last time I\nwas in Japan I bought some chairs, brought them home, and put them in my\nsun porch. But the sun peeled the paint, so I went downtown the other day\nand bought some paint and painted the chairs myself. Would you like to see\nwhat sort of job I can do painting chairs? All right. Come up to my home\nand have lunch with me and I’ll show you.’\nAfter lunch, Mr. Eastman showed Adamson the chairs he had brought\nfrom Japan. They weren’t worth more than a few dollars, but George\nEastman, now a multimillionaire, was proud of them because he himself\nhad painted them.\nThe order for the seats amounted to $90,000. Who do you suppose got\nthe order – James Adamson or one of his competitors?\nFrom the time of this story until Mr. Eastman’s death, he and James\nAdamson were close friends.\nClaude Marais, a restaurant owner in Rouen, France, used this\nprinciple and saved his restaurant the loss of a key employee. This woman\nhad been in his employ for five years and was a vital link between M.\nMarais and his staff of twenty-one people. He was shocked to receive a\nregistered letter from her advising him of her resignation.\nM. Marais reported: ‘I was very surprised and, even more,\ndisappointed, because I was under the impression that I had been fair to her\nand receptive to her needs. Inasmuch as she was a friend as well as an\nemployee, I probably had taken her too much for granted and maybe was\neven more demanding of her than of other employees.\n‘I could not, of course, accept this resignation without some\nexplanation. I took her aside and said, “Paulette, you must understand that I\ncannot accept your resignation. You mean a great deal to me and to this\ncompany, and you are as important to the success of this restaurant as I","am.” I repeated this in front of the entire staff, and I invited her to my home\nand reiterated my confidence in her with my family present.\n‘Paulette withdrew her resignation, and today I can rely on her as\nnever before. I frequently reinforce this by expressing my appreciation for\nwhat she does and showing her how important she is to me and to the\nrestaurant.’\n‘Talk to people about themselves,’ said Disraeli, one of the shrewdest\nmen who ever ruled the British Empire. ‘Talk to people about themselves\nand they will listen for hours.’\nPRINCIPLE 6\nMake the other person feel important – and do it sincerely.","IN A NUTSHELL\nSIX WAYS TO MAKE PEOPLE LIKE YOU\nPRINCIPLE 1\nBecome genuinely interested in other people.\nPRINCIPLE 2\nSmile.\nPRINCIPLE 3\nRemember that a person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most\nimportant sound in any language.\nPRINCIPLE 4\nBe a good listener.

I was manager at the time for Sir Ross Smith. During\nthe war, Sir Ross had been the Australian ace out in Palestine; and shortly\nafter peace was declared, he astonished the world by flying halfway around\nit in thirty days. No such feat had ever been attempted before. It created a\ntremendous sensation. The Australian government awarded him fifty\nthousand dollars; the King of England knighted him; and, for a while, he\nwas the most talked-about man under the Union Jack. I was attending a\nbanquet one night given in Sir Ross’s honour; and during the dinner, the\nman sitting next to me told a humorous story which hinged on the quotation\n‘There’s a divinity that shapes our ends, rough-hew them how we will.’\nThe raconteur mentioned that the quotation was from the Bible. He\nwas wrong. I knew that. I knew it positively. There couldn’t be the slightest\ndoubt about it. And so, to get a feeling of importance and display my\nsuperiority, I appointed myself as an unsolicited and unwelcome committee\nof one to correct him. He stuck to his guns. What? From Shakespeare?\nImpossible! Absurd! That quotation was from the Bible. And he knew it.\nThe storyteller was sitting on my right; and Frank Gammond, an old\nfriend of mine, was seated at my left. Mr. Gammond had devoted years to\nthe study of Shakespeare. So the storyteller and I agreed to submit the\nquestion to Mr. Gammond. Mr. Gammond listened, kicked me under the\ntable, and then said: ‘Dale, you are wrong. The gentleman is right. It is from\nthe Bible.’\nOn our way home that night, I said to Mr. Gammond: ‘Frank, you\nknew that quotation was from Shakespeare.’\n‘Yes, of course,’ he replied, ‘Hamlet, Act Five, Scene Two. But we\nwere guests at a festive occasion, my dear Dale. Why prove to a man he is\nwrong? Is that going to make him like you? Why not let him save his face?\nHe didn’t ask for your opinion. He didn’t want it. Why argue with him?\nAlways avoid the acute angle.’ The man who said that taught me a lesson","I’ll never forget. I not only had made the storyteller uncomfortable, but had\nput my friend in an embarrassing situation. How much better it would have\nbeen had I not become argumentative.\nIt was a sorely needed lesson because I had been an inveterate arguer.\nDuring my youth, I had argued with my brother about everything under the\nMilky Way. When I went to college, I studied logic and argumentation and\nwent in for debating contests. Talk about being from Missouri, I was born\nthere. I had to be shown. Later, I taught debating and argumentation in New\nYork; and once, I am ashamed to admit, I planned to write a book on the\nsubject. Since then, I have listened to, engaged in, and watched the effect of\nthousands of arguments. As a result of all this, I have come to the\nconclusion that there is only one way under high heaven to get the best of\nan argument – and that is to avoid it. Avoid it as you would avoid\nrattlesnakes and earthquakes.\nNine times out of ten, an argument ends with each of the contestants\nmore firmly convinced than ever that he is absolutely right.\nYou can’t win an argument. You can’t because if you lose it, you lose\nit; and if you win it, you lose it. Why? Well, suppose you triumph over the\nother man and shoot his argument full of holes and prove that he is non\ncompos mentis. Then what? You will feel fine. But what about him? You\nhave made him feel inferior. You have hurt his pride. He will resent your\ntriumph. And –\nA man convinced against his will\nIs of the same opinion still.\nYears ago Patrick J. O’Haire joined one of my classes. He had had little\neducation, and how he loved a scrap! He had once been a chauffeur, and he\ncame to me because he had been trying, without much success, to sell\ntrucks. A little questioning brought out the fact that he was continually\nscrapping with and antagonising the very people he was trying to do\nbusiness with. If a prospect said anything derogatory about the trucks he\nwas selling, Pat saw red and was right at the customer’s throat. Pat won a\nlot of arguments in those days. As he said to me afterward, ‘I often walked\nout of an office saying: “I told that bird something.” Sure I had told him\nsomething, but I hadn’t sold him anything.’","My first problem was not to teach Patrick J. O’Haire to talk. My\nimmediate task was to train him to refrain from talking and to avoid verbal\nfights.\nMr. O’Haire became one of the star salesmen for the White Motor\nCompany in New York. How did he do it? Here is his story in his own\nwords: ‘If I walk into a buyer’s office now and he says: “What? A White\ntruck? They’re no good! I wouldn’t take one if you gave it to me. I’m going\nto buy the Whose-It truck,” I say, “The Whose-It is a good truck. If you buy\nthe Whose-It, you’ll never make a mistake. The Whose-Its are made by a\nfine company and sold by good people.”\n‘He is speechless then. There is no room for an argument. If he says\nthe Whose-It is best and I say sure it is, he has to stop. He can’t keep on all\nafternoon saying, “It’s the best” when I’m agreeing with him. We then get\noff the subject of Whose-It and I begin to talk about the good points of the\nWhite truck.\n‘There was a time when a remark like his first one would have made\nme see scarlet and red and orange. I would start arguing against the Whose-\nIt; and the more I argued against it, the more my prospect argued in favour\nof it; and the more he argued, the more he sold himself on my competitor’s\nproduct.\n‘As I look back now I wonder how I was ever able to sell anything. I\nlost years of my life in scrapping and arguing. I keep my mouth shut now. It\npays.’\nAs wise old Ben Franklin used to say:\nIf you argue and rankle and contradict, you may achieve a victory\nsometimes; but it will be an empty victory because you will never\nget your opponent’s good will.\nSo figure it out for yourself. Which would you rather have, an academic,\ntheatrical victory or a person’s good will? You can seldom have both.\nThe Boston Transcript once printed this bit of significant doggerel:\nHere lies the body of William Jay,\nWho died maintaining his right of way –\nHe was right, dead right, as he sped along,\nBut he’s just as dead as if he were wrong.","You may be right, dead right, as you speed along in your argument; but as\nfar as changing another’s mind is concerned, you will probably be just as\nfutile as if you were wrong.\nFrederick S. Parsons, an income tax consultant, had been disputing and\nwrangling for an hour with a government tax inspector. An item of nine\nthousand dollars was at stake. Mr. Parsons claimed that this nine thousand\ndollars was in reality a bad debt, that it would never be collected, that it\nought not to be taxed. ‘Bad debt, my eye!’ retorted the inspector. ‘It must be\ntaxed.’\n‘This inspector was cold, arrogant and stubborn,’ Mr. Parsons said as\nhe told the story to the class. ‘Reason was wasted and so were facts . . . The\nlonger we argued, the more stubborn he became. So I decided to avoid\nargument, change the subject, and give him appreciation.\n‘I said, “I suppose this is a very petty matter in comparison with the\nreally important and difficult decisions you’re required to make. I’ve made\na study of taxation myself. But I’ve had to get my knowledge from books.\nYou are getting yours from the firing line of experience. I sometimes wish I\nhad a job like yours. It would teach me a lot.” I meant every word I said.\n‘“Well.” The inspector straightened up in his chair, leaned back, and\ntalked for a long time about his work, telling me of the clever frauds he had\nuncovered. His tone gradually became friendly, and presently he was telling\nme about his children. As he left, he advised me that he would consider my\nproblem further and give me his decision in a few days.\n‘He called at my office three days later and informed me that he had\ndecided to leave the tax return exactly as it was filed.’\nThis tax inspector was demonstrating one of the most common of\nhuman frailties. He wanted a feeling of importance; and as long as Mr.\nParsons argued with him, he got his feeling of importance by loudly\nasserting his authority. But as soon as his importance was admitted and the\nargument stopped and he was permitted to expand his ego, he became a\nsympathetic and kindly human being.\nBuddha said: ‘Hatred is never ended by hatred but by love,’ and a\nmisunderstanding is never ended by an argument but by tact, diplomacy,\nconciliation and a sympathetic desire to see the other person’s viewpoint.\nLincoln once reprimanded a young army officer for indulging in a\nviolent controversy with an associate. ‘No man who is resolved to make the\nmost of himself,’ said Lincoln, ‘can spare time for personal contention. Still","less can he afford to take the consequences, including the vitiation of his\ntemper and the loss of self-control. Yield larger things to which you show\nno more than equal rights; and yield lesser ones though clearly your own.\nBetter give your path to a dog than be bitten by him in contesting for the\nright. Even killing the dog would not cure the bite.’\nIn an article in Bits and Pieces,\n1 some suggestions are made on how to\nkeep a disagreement from becoming an argument:\nWelcome the disagreement. Remember the slogan, ‘When two\npartners always agree, one of them is not necessary.’ If there is\nsome point you haven’t thought about, be thankful if it is brought\nto your attention. Perhaps this disagreement is your opportunity to\nbe corrected before you make a serious mistake.\nDistrust your first instinctive impression. Our first natural\nreaction in a disagreeable situation is to be defensive. Be careful.\nKeep calm and watch out for your first reaction. It may be you at\nyour worst, not your best.\nControl your temper. Remember, you can measure the size of a\nperson by what makes him or her angry.\nListen first. Give your opponents a chance to talk. Let them\nfinish. Do not resist, defend or debate. This only raises barriers.\nTry to build bridges of understanding. Don’t build higher barriers\nof misunderstanding.\nLook for areas of agreement. When you have heard your\nopponents out, dwell first on the points and areas on which you\nagree.\nBe honest. Look for areas where you can admit error and say so.\nApologize for your mistakes. It will help disarm your opponents\nand reduce defensiveness.\nPromise to think over your opponents’ ideas and study them\ncarefully. And mean it. Your opponents may be right. It is a lot\neasier at this stage to agree to think about their points than to","move rapidly ahead and find yourself in a position where your\nopponents can say: ‘We tried to tell you, but you wouldn’t listen.’\nThank your opponents sincerely for their interest. Anyone who\ntakes the time to disagree with you is interested in the same things\nyou are. Think of them as people who really want to help you,\nand you may turn your opponents into friends.\nPostpone action to give both sides time to think through the\nproblem. Suggest that a new meeting be held later that day or the\nnext day, when all the facts may be brought to bear. In preparation\nfor this meeting, ask yourself some hard questions:\nCould my opponents be right? Partly right? Is there truth or\nmerit in their position or argument? Is my reaction one that will\nrelieve the problem, or will it just relieve any frustration? Will my\nreaction drive my opponents further away or draw them closer to\nme? Will my reaction elevate the estimation good people have of\nme? Will I win or lose? What price will I have to pay if I win? If I\nam quiet about it, will the disagreement blow over? Is this\ndifficult situation an opportunity for me?\nOpera tenor Jan Peerce, after he was married nearly fifty years, once said:\n‘My wife and I made a pact a long time ago, and we’ve kept it no matter\nhow angry we’ve grown with each other. When one yells, the other should\nlisten – because when two people yell, there is no communication, just\nnoise and bad vibrations.’\nPRINCIPLE 1\nThe only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.\n1. Bits and Pieces, published by The Economics Press, Fairfield, N.J.","WHEN THEODORE ROOSEVELT was in the White House, he confessed that if\nhe could be right 75 percent of the time, he would reach the highest\nmeasure of his expectation.\nIf that was the highest rating that one of the most distinguished men of\nthe twentieth century could hope to obtain, what about you and me?\nIf you can be sure of being right only 55 percent of the time, you can\ngo down to Wall Street and make a million dollars a day. If you can’t be\nsure of being right even 55 percent of the time, why should you tell other\npeople they are wrong?\nYou can tell people they are wrong by a look or an intonation or a\ngesture just as eloquently as you can in words – and if you tell them they\nare wrong, do you make them want to agree with you? Never! For you have\nstruck a direct blow at their intelligence, judgement, pride and self-respect.\nThat will make them want to strike back. But it will never make them want\nto change their minds. You may then hurl at them all the logic of a Plato or\nan Immanuel Kant, but you will not alter their opinions, for you have hurt\ntheir feelings.\nNever begin by announcing ‘I am going to prove so-and-so to you.’\nThat’s bad. That’s tantamount to saying: ‘I’m smarter than you are. I’m\ngoing to tell you a thing or two and make you change your mind.’\nThat is a challenge. It arouses opposition and makes the listener want\nto battle with you before you even start.\nIt is difficult, under even the most benign conditions, to change\npeople’s minds. So why make it harder? Why handicap yourself?\nIf you are going to prove anything, don’t let anybody know it. Do it so\nsubtly, so adroitly, that no one will feel that you are doing it. This was\nexpressed succinctly by Alexander Pope:","Men must be taught as if you taught them not\nAnd things unknown proposed as things forgot.\nOver three hundred years ago Galileo said:\nYou cannot teach a man anything;\nyou can only help him to find it within himself.\nAs Lord Chesterfield said to his son:\nBe wiser than other people if you can;\nbut do not tell them so.\nSocrates said repeatedly to his followers in Athens:\nOne thing only I know, and that\nis that I know nothing.\nWell, I can’t hope to be any smarter than Socrates, so I have quit telling\npeople they are wrong. And I find that it pays.\nIf a person makes a statement that you think is wrong – yes, even that\nyou know is wrong – isn’t it better to begin by saying: ‘Well, now, look. I\nthought otherwise but I may be wrong. I frequently am. And if I am wrong,\nI want to be put right. Let’s examine the facts.’\nThere’s magic, positive magic, in such phrases as: ‘I may be wrong, I\nfrequently am. Let’s examine the facts.’\nNobody in the heavens above or on the earth beneath or in the waters\nunder the earth will ever object to your saying: ‘I may be wrong. Let’s\nexamine the facts.’\nOne of our class members who used this approach in dealing with\ncustomers was Harold Reinke, a Dodge dealer in Billings, Montana. He\nreported that because of the pressures of the automobile business, he was\noften hard-boiled and callous when dealing with customers’ complaints.\nThis caused flared tempers, loss of business and general unpleasantness.\nHe told his class: ‘Recognising that this was getting me nowhere fast, I\ntried a new tack. I would say something like this: “Our dealership has made\nso many mistakes that I am frequently ashamed. We may have erred in your\ncase. Tell me about it.”","‘This approach becomes quite disarming, and by the time the customer\nreleases his feelings, he is usually much more reasonable when it comes to\nsettling the matter. In fact, several customers have thanked me for having\nsuch an understanding attitude. And two of them have even brought in\nfriends to buy new cars. In this highly competitive market, we need more of\nthis type of customer, and I believe that showing respect for all customers’\nopinions and treating them diplomatically and courteously will help beat the\ncompetition.’\nYou will never get into trouble by admitting that you may be wrong.\nThat will stop all argument and inspire your opponent to be just as fair and\nopen and broad-minded as you are. It will make him want to admit that he,\ntoo, may be wrong.\nIf you know positively that a person is wrong, and you bluntly tell him\nor her so, what happens? Let me illustrate. Mr. S –, a young New York\nattorney, once argued a rather important case before the United States\nSupreme Court (Lustgarten v. Fleet Corporation 280 U.S. 320). The case\ninvolved a considerable sum of money and an important question of law.\nDuring the argument, one of the Supreme Court justices said to him: ‘The\nstatute of limitations in admiralty law is six years, is it not?’\nMr. S – stopped, stared at the Justice for a moment, and then said\nbluntly: ‘Your Honour, there is no statute of limitations in admiralty.’\n‘A hush fell on the court,’ said Mr. S – as he related his experience to\none of the author’s classes, ‘and the temperature in the room seemed to drop\nto zero. I was right. Justice – was wrong. And I had told him so. But did\nthat make him friendly? No. I still believe that I had the law on my side.\nAnd I know that I spoke better than I ever spoke before. But I didn’t\npersuade. I made the enormous blunder of telling a very learned and famous\nman that he was wrong.’\nFew people are logical. Most of us are prejudiced and biased. Most of\nus are blighted with preconceived notions, with jealousy, suspicion, fear,\nenvy and pride. And most citizens don’t want to change their minds about\ntheir religion or their haircut or communism or their favourite movie star.\nSo, if you are inclined to tell people they are wrong, please read the\nfollowing paragraph every morning before breakfast. It is from James\nHarvey Robinson’s enlightening book The Mind in the Making.","We sometimes find ourselves changing our minds without any\nresistance or heavy emotion, but if we are told we are wrong, we\nresent the imputation and harden our hearts. We are incredibly\nheedless in the formation of our beliefs, but find ourselves filled\nwith an illicit passion for them when anyone proposes to rob us of\ntheir companionship. It is obviously not the ideas themselves that\nare dear to us, but our self-esteem which is threatened . . . The\nlittle word ‘my’ is the most important one in human affairs, and\nproperly to reckon with it is the beginning of wisdom. It has the\nsame force whether it is ‘my’ dinner, ‘my’ dog, and ‘my’ house,\nor ‘my’ father, ‘my’ country, and ‘my’ God. We not only resent\nthe imputation that our watch is wrong, or our car shabby, but that\nour conception of the canals of Mars, of the pronunciation of\n‘Epictetus,’ of the medicinal value of salicin, or of the date of\nSargon I is subject to revision. We like to continue to believe what\nwe have been accustomed to accept as true, and the resentment\naroused when doubt is cast upon any of our assumptions leads us\nto seek every manner of excuse for clinging to it. The result is\nthat most of our so-called reasoning consists in finding arguments\nfor going on believing as we already do.\nCarl Rogers, the eminent psychologist, wrote in his book On Becoming a\nPerson:\nI have found it of enormous value when I can permit myself to\nunderstand the other person. The way in which I have worded this\nstatement may seem strange to you. Is it necessary to permit\noneself to understand another? I think it is. Our first reaction to\nmost of the statements (which we hear from other people) is an\nevaluation or judgment, rather than an understanding of it. When\nsomeone expresses some feeling, attitude or belief, our tendency\nis almost immediately to feel ‘that’s right,’ or ‘that’s stupid,’\n‘that’s abnormal,’ ‘that’s unreasonable,’ ‘that’s incorrect,’ ‘that’s\nnot nice.’ Very rarely do we permit ourselves to understand\nprecisely what the meaning of the statement is to the other\nperson.\n1","I once employed an interior decorator to make some draperies for my home.\nWhen the bill arrived, I was dismayed.\nA few days later, a friend dropped in and looked at the draperies. The\nprice was mentioned, and she exclaimed with a note of triumph: ‘What?\nThat’s awful. I am afraid he put one over on you.’\nTrue? Yes, she had told the truth, but few people like to listen to truths\nthat reflect on their judgement. So, being human, I tried to defend myself. I\npointed out that the best is eventually the cheapest, that one can’t expect to\nget quality and artistic taste at bargain-basement prices, and so on and on.\nThe next day another friend dropped in, admired the draperies,\nbubbled over with enthusiasm, and expressed a wish that she could afford\nsuch exquisite creations for her home. My reaction was totally different.\n‘Well, to tell the truth,’ I said, ‘I can’t afford them myself. I paid too much.\nI’m sorry I ordered them.’\nWhen we are wrong, we may admit it to ourselves. And if we are\nhandled gently and tactfully, we may admit it to others and even take pride\nin our frankness and broad-mindedness. But not if someone else is trying to\nram the unpalatable fact down our oesophagus.\nHorace Greeley, the most famous editor in America during the time of\nthe Civil War, disagreed violently with Lincoln’s policies. He believed that\nhe could drive Lincoln into agreeing with him by a campaign of argument,\nridicule and abuse. He waged this bitter campaign month after month, year\nafter year. In fact, he wrote a brutal, bitter, sarcastic and personal attack on\nPresident Lincoln the night Booth shot him.\nBut did all this bitterness make Lincoln agree with Greeley? Not at all.\nRidicule and abuse never do.\nIf you want some excellent suggestions about dealing with people and\nmanaging yourself and improving your personality, read Benjamin\nFranklin’s autobiography – one of the most fascinating life stories ever\nwritten, one of the classics of American literature. Ben Franklin tells how\nhe conquered the iniquitous habit of argument and transformed himself into\none of the most able, suave and diplomatic men in American history.\nOne day, when Ben Franklin was a blundering youth, an old Quaker\nfriend took him aside and lashed him with a few stinging truths, something\nlike this:","Ben, you are impossible. Your opinions have a slap in them for\neveryone who differs with you. They have become so offensive\nthat nobody cares for them. Your friends find they enjoy\nthemselves better when you are not around. You know so much\nthat no man can tell you anything. Indeed, no man is going to try,\nfor the effort would lead only to discomfort and hard work. So\nyou are not likely ever to know any more than you do now, which\nis very little.\nOne of the finest things I know about Ben Franklin is the way he accepted\nthat smarting rebuke. He was big enough and wise enough to realise that it\nwas true, to sense that he was headed for failure and social disaster. So he\nmade a right-about-face. He began immediately to change his insolent,\nopinionated ways.\n‘I made it a rule,’ said Franklin, ‘to forbear all direct contradiction to\nthe sentiment of others, and all positive assertion of my own. I even forbade\nmyself the use of every word or expression in the language that imported a\nfix’d opinion, such as “certainly,” “undoubtedly,” etc., and I adopted,\ninstead of them, “I conceive,” “I apprehend,” or “I imagine” a thing to be so\nor so, or “it so appears to me at present.” When another asserted something\nthat I thought an error, I deny’d myself the pleasure of contradicting him\nabruptly, and of showing immediately some absurdity in his proposition:\nand in answering I began by observing that in certain cases or\ncircumstances his opinion would be right, but in the present case there\nappear’d or seem’d to me some difference, etc. I soon found the advantage\nof this change in my manner; the conversations I engag’d in went on more\npleasantly. The modest way in which I propos’d my opinions procur’d them\na readier reception and less contradiction; I had less mortification when I\nwas found to be in the wrong, and I more easily prevail’d with others to\ngive up their mistakes and join with me when I happened to be in the right.\n‘And this mode, which I at first put on with some violence to natural\ninclination, became at length so easy, and so habitual to me, that perhaps for\nthese fifty years past no one has ever heard a dogmatical expression escape\nme. And to this habit (after my character of integrity) I think it principally\nowing that I had earned so much weight with my fellow citizens when I\nproposed new institutions, or alterations in the old, and so much influence\nin public councils when I became a member; for I was but a bad speaker,","never eloquent, subject to much hesitation in my choice of words, hardly\ncorrect in language, and yet I generally carried my points.’\nHow do Ben Franklin’s methods work in business? Let’s take two\nexamples.\nKatherine A. Allred of Kings Mountain, North Carolina, is an\nindustrial engineering supervisor for a yarn-processing plant. She told one\nof our classes how she handled a sensitive problem before and after taking\nour training:\n‘Part of my responsibility,’ she reported, ‘deals with setting up and\nmaintaining incentive systems and standards for our operators so they can\nmake more money by producing more yarn. The system we were using had\nworked fine when we had only two or three different types of yarn, but\nrecently we had expanded our inventory and capabilities to enable us to run\nmore than twelve different varieties. The present system was no longer\nadequate to pay the operators fairly for the work being performed and give\nthem an incentive to increase production. I had worked up a new system\nwhich would enable us to pay the operator by the class of yarn she was\nrunning at any one particular time. With my new system in hand, I entered\nthe meeting determined to prove to the management that my system was the\nright approach. I told them in detail how they were wrong and showed\nwhere they were being unfair and how I had all the answers they needed. To\nsay the least, I failed miserably! I had become so busy defending my\nposition on the new system that I had left them no opening to graciously\nadmit their problems on the old one. The issue was dead.\n‘After several sessions of this course, I realised all too well where I\nhad made my mistakes. I called another meeting and this time I asked\nwhere they felt their problems were. We discussed each point, and I asked\nthem their opinions on which was the best way to proceed. With a few low-\nkeyed suggestions, at proper intervals, I let them develop my system\nthemselves. At the end of the meeting when I actually presented my system,\nthey enthusiastically accepted it.\n‘I am convinced now that nothing good is accomplished and a lot of\ndamage can be done if you tell a person straight out that he or she is wrong.\nYou only succeed in stripping that person of self-dignity and making\nyourself an unwelcome part of any discussion.’\nLet’s take another example – and remember these cases I am citing are\ntypical of the experiences of thousands of other people. R.V. Crowley was a","salesman for a lumber company in New York. Crowley admitted that he had\nbeen telling hard-boiled lumber inspectors for years that they were wrong.\nAnd he had won the arguments too. But it hadn’t done any good. ‘For these\nlumber inspectors,’ said Mr. Crowley, ‘are like baseball umpires. Once they\nmake a decision, they never change it.’\nMr. Crowley saw that his firm was losing thousands of dollars through\nthe arguments he won. So while taking my course, he resolved to change\ntactics and abandon arguments. With what results? Here is the story as he\ntold it to the fellow members of his class:\n‘One morning the phone rang in my office. A hot and bothered person\nat the other end proceeded to inform me that a car of lumber we had\nshipped into his plant was entirely unsatisfactory. His firm had stopped\nunloading and requested that we make immediate arrangements to remove\nthe stock from their yard. After about one-fourth of the car had been\nunloaded, their lumber inspector reported that the lumber was running 55\npercent below grade. Under the circumstances, they refused to accept it.\n‘I immediately started for his plant and on the way turned over in my\nmind the best way to handle the situation. Ordinarily, under such\ncircumstances, I should have quoted grading rules and tried, as a result of\nmy own experience and knowledge as a lumber inspector, to convince the\nother inspector that the lumber was actually up to grade, and that he was\nmisinterpreting the rules in his inspection. However, I thought I would\napply the principles learned in this training.\n‘When I arrived at the plant, I found the purchasing agent and the\nlumber inspector in a wicked humour, both set for an argument and a fight.\nWe walked out to the car that was being unloaded, and I requested that they\ncontinue to unload so that I could see how things were going. I asked the\ninspector to go right ahead and lay out the rejects, as he had been doing, and\nto put the good pieces in another pile.\n‘After watching him for a while it began to dawn on me that his\ninspection actually was much too strict and that he was misinterpreting the\nrules. This particular lumber was white pine, and I knew the inspector was\nthoroughly schooled in hard woods but not a competent, experienced\ninspector on white pine. White pine happened to be my own strong suit, but\ndid I offer any objection to the way he was grading the lumber? None\nwhatever. I kept on watching and gradually began to ask questions as to\nwhy certain pieces were not satisfactory. I didn’t for one instant insinuate","that the inspector was wrong. I emphasised that my only reason for asking\nwas in order that we could give his firm exactly what they wanted in future\nshipments.\n‘By asking questions in a very friendly, cooperative spirit, and\ninsisting continually that they were right in laying out boards not\nsatisfactory to their purpose, I got him warmed up, and the strained\nrelations between us began to thaw and melt away. An occasional carefully\nput remark on my part gave birth to the idea in his mind that possibly some\nof these rejected pieces were actually within the grade that they had bought,\nand that their requirements demanded a more expensive grade. I was very\ncareful, however, not to let him think I was making an issue of this point.\n‘Gradually his whole attitude changed. He finally admitted to me that\nhe was not experienced on white pine and began to ask me questions about\neach piece as it came out of the car. I would explain why such a piece came\nwithin the grade specified, but kept on insisting that we did not want him to\ntake it if it was unsuitable for their purpose. He finally got to the point\nwhere he felt guilty every time he put a piece in the rejected pile. And at\nlast he saw that the mistake was on their part for not having specified as\ngood a grade as they needed.\n‘The ultimate outcome was that he went through the entire carload\nagain after I left, accepted the whole lot, and we received a check in full.\n‘In that one instance alone, a little tact, and the determination to refrain\nfrom telling the other man he was wrong, saved my company a substantial\namount of cash, and it would be hard to place a money value on the good\nwill that was saved.’\nMartin Luther King was asked how, as a pacifist, he could be an\nadmirer of Air Force General Daniel ‘Chappie’ James, then the nation’s\nhighest-ranking black officer. Dr. King replied, ‘I judge people by their own\nprinciples – not by my own.’\nIn a similar way, General Robert E. Lee once spoke to the president of\nthe Confederacy, Jefferson Davis, in the most glowing terms about a certain\nofficer under his command. Another officer in attendance was astonished.\n‘General,’ he said, ‘do you not know that the man of whom you speak so\nhighly is one of your bitterest enemies who misses no opportunity to malign\nyou?’ ‘Yes,’ replied General Lee, ‘but the president asked my opinion of\nhim; he did not ask for his opinion of me.’","By the way, I am not revealing anything new in this chapter. Two\nthousand years ago, Jesus said: ‘Agree with thine adversary quickly.’\nAnd 2,200 years before Christ was born, King Akhtoi of Egypt gave\nhis son some shrewd advice – advice that is sorely needed today. ‘Be\ndiplomatic,’ counselled the King. ‘It will help you gain your point.’\nIn other words, don’t argue with your customer or your spouse or your\nadversary. Don’t tell them they are wrong, don’t get them stirred up. Use a\nlittle diplomacy.\nPRINCIPLE 2\nShow respect for the other person’s opinions. Never say, ‘You’re\nwrong.’\n1. Adapted from Carl R. Rogers, On Becoming a Person (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1961), pp. 18ff.","WITHIN A MINUTE’S walk of my house there was a wild stretch of virgin\ntimber, where the blackberry thickets foamed white in the springtime,\nwhere the squirrels nested and reared their young, and the horse weeds grew\nas tall as a horse’s head. This unspoiled woodland was called Forest Park –\nand it was a forest, probably not much different in appearance from what it\nwas when Columbus discovered America. I frequently walked in this park\nwith Rex, my little Boston bulldog. He was a friendly, harmless little\nhound; and since we rarely met anyone in the park, I took Rex along\nwithout a leash or a muzzle.\nOne day we encountered a mounted policeman in the park, a\npoliceman itching to show his authority.\n‘What do you mean by letting that dog run loose in the park without a\nmuzzle and leash?’ he reprimanded me. ‘Don’t you know it’s against the\nlaw?’\n‘Yes, I know it is,’ I replied softly, ‘but I didn’t think he would do any\nharm out here.’\n‘You didn’t think! You didn’t think! The law doesn’t give a tinker’s\ndamn about what you think. That dog might kill a squirrel or bite a child.\nNow, I’m going to let you off this time; but if I catch this dog out here again\nwithout a muzzle and a leash, you’ll have to tell it to the judge.’\nI meekly promised to obey.\nAnd I did obey – for a few times. But Rex didn’t like the muzzle, and\nneither did I; so we decided to take a chance. Everything was lovely for a\nwhile, and then we struck a snag. Rex and I raced over the brow of a hill\none afternoon and there, suddenly – to my dismay – I saw the majesty of\nthe law, astride a bay horse. Rex was out in front, heading straight for the\nofficer.\nI was in for it. I knew it. So I didn’t wait until the policeman started\ntalking. I beat him to it. I said: ‘Officer, you’ve caught me red-handed. I’m","guilty. I have no alibis, no excuses. You warned me last week that if I\nbrought the dog out here again without a muzzle you would fine me.’\n‘Well, now,’ the policeman responded in a soft tone. ‘I know it’s a\ntemptation to let a little dog like that have a run out here when nobody is\naround.’\n‘Sure it’s a temptation,’ I replied, ‘but it is against the law.’\n‘Well, a little dog like that isn’t going to harm anybody,’ the policeman\nremonstrated.\n‘No, but he may kill squirrels,’ I said.\n‘Well now, I think you are taking this a bit too seriously,’ he told me.\n‘I’ll tell you what you do. You just let him run over the hill there where I\ncan’t see him – and we’ll forget all about it.’\nThat policeman, being human, wanted a feeling of importance; so\nwhen I began to condemn myself, the only way he could nourish his self-\nesteem was to take the magnanimous attitude of showing mercy.\nBut suppose I had tried to defend myself – well, did you ever argue\nwith a policeman?\nBut instead of breaking lances with him, I admitted that he was\nabsolutely right and I was absolutely wrong; I admitted it quickly, openly,\nand with enthusiasm. The affair terminated graciously in my taking his side\nand his taking my side. Lord Chesterfield himself could hardly have been\nmore gracious than this mounted policeman, who, only a week previously,\nhad threatened to have the law on me.\nIf we know we are going to be rebuked anyhow, isn’t it far better to\nbeat the other person to it and do it ourselves? Isn’t it much easier to listen\nto self-criticism than to bear condemnation from alien lips?\nSay about yourself all the derogatory things you know the other person\nis thinking or wants to say or intends to say – and say them before that\nperson has a chance to say them. The chances are a hundred to one that a\ngenerous, forgiving attitude will be taken and your mistakes will be\nminimised just as the mounted policeman did with me and Rex.\nFerdinand E. Warren, a commercial artist, used this technique to win\nthe good will of a petulant, scolding buyer of art.\n‘It is important, in making drawings for advertising and publishing\npurposes, to be precise and very exact,’ Mr. Warren said as he told the story.\n‘Some art editors demand that their commissions be executed\nimmediately; and in these cases, some slight error is liable to occur. I knew","one art director in particular who was always delighted to find fault with\nsome little thing. I have often left his office in disgust, not because of the\ncriticism, but because of his method of attack. Recently I delivered a rush\njob to this editor, and he phoned me to call at his office immediately. He\nsaid something was wrong. When I arrived, I found just what I had\nanticipated – and dreaded. He was hostile, gloating over his chance to\ncriticise. He demanded with heat why I had done so and so. My opportunity\nhad come to apply the self-criticism I had been studying about. So I said:\n“Mr. So-and-so, if what you say is true, I am at fault and there is absolutely\nno excuse for my blunder. I have been doing drawings for you long enough\nto know better. I’m ashamed of myself.”\n‘Immediately he started to defend me. “Yes, you’re right, but after all,\nthis isn’t a serious mistake. It is only—”\n‘I interrupted him. “Any mistake,” I said, “may be costly and they are\nall irritating.”\n‘He started to break in, but I wouldn’t let him. I was having a grand\ntime. For the first time in my life, I was criticising myself – and I loved it.\n‘“I should have been more careful,” I continued. “You give me a lot of\nwork, and you deserve the best; so I’m going to do this drawing all over.”\n‘“No! No!” he protested. “I wouldn’t think of putting you to all that\ntrouble.” He praised my work, assured me that he wanted only a minor\nchange and that my slight error hadn’t cost his firm any money; and, after\nall, it was a mere detail – not worth worrying about.\n‘My eagerness to criticise myself took all the fight out of him. He\nended up by taking me to lunch; and before we parted, he gave me a cheque\nand another commission.’\nThere is a certain degree of satisfaction in having the courage to admit\none’s errors. It not only clears the air of guilt and defensiveness, but often\nhelps solve the problem created by the error.\nBruce Harvey of Albuquerque, New Mexico, had incorrectly\nauthorised payment of full wages to an employee on sick leave. When he\ndiscovered his error, he brought it to the attention of the employee and\nexplained that to correct the mistake he would have to reduce his next\npaycheque by the entire amount of the overpayment. The employee pleaded\nthat as that would cause him a serious financial problem, could the money\nbe repaid over a period of time? In order to do this, Harvey explained, he\nwould have to obtain his supervisor’s approval. ‘And this I knew,’ reported","Harvey, ‘would result in a boss-type explosion. While trying to decide how\nto handle this situation better, I realised that the whole mess was my fault\nand I would have to admit it to my boss.\n‘I walked into his office, told him that I had made a mistake and then\ninformed him of the complete facts. He replied in an explosive manner that\nit was the fault of the personnel department. I repeated that it was my fault.\nHe exploded again about carelessness in the accounting department. Again I\nexplained it was my fault. He blamed two other people in the office. But\neach time I reiterated it was my fault. Finally, he looked at me and said,\n“Okay, it was your fault. Now straighten it out.” The error was corrected\nand nobody got into trouble. I felt great because I was able to handle a tense\nsituation and had the courage not to seek alibis. My boss has had more\nrespect for me ever since.’\nAny fool can try to defend his or her mistakes – and most fools do –\nbut it raises one above the herd and gives one a feeling of nobility and\nexultation to admit one’s mistakes. For example, one of the most beautiful\nthings that history records about Robert E. Lee is the way he blamed\nhimself and only himself for the failure of Pickett’s charge at Gettysburg.\nPickett’s charge was undoubtedly the most brilliant and picturesque\nattack that ever occurred in the Western world. General George E. Pickett\nhimself was picturesque. He wore his hair so long that his auburn locks\nalmost touched his shoulders; and, like Napoleon in his Italian campaigns,\nhe wrote ardent love-letters almost daily while on the battlefield. His\ndevoted troops cheered him that tragic July afternoon as he rode off jauntily\ntoward the Union lines, his cap set at a rakish angle over his right ear. They\ncheered and they followed him, man touching man, rank pressing rank, with\nbanners flying and bayonets gleaming in the sun. It was a gallant sight.\nDaring. Magnificent. A murmur of admiration ran through the Union lines\nas they beheld it.\nPickett’s troops swept forward at an easy trot, through orchard and\ncornfield, across a meadow and over a ravine. All the time, the enemy’s\ncannon was tearing ghastly holes in their ranks. But on they pressed, grim,\nirresistible.\nSuddenly the Union infantry rose from behind the stone wall on\nCemetery Ridge where they had been hiding and fired volley after volley\ninto Pickett’s onrushing troops. The crest of the hill was a sheet of flame, a\nslaughterhouse, a blazing volcano. In a few minutes, all of Pickett’s brigade","commanders except one were down, and four-fifths of his five thousand\nmen had fallen.\nGeneral Lewis A. Armistead, leading the troops in the final plunge, ran\nforward, vaulted over the stone wall, and, waving his cap on the top of his\nsword, shouted:\n‘Give ’em the steel, boys!’\nThey did. They leaped over the wall, bayoneted their enemies,\nsmashed skulls with clubbed muskets, and planted the battleflags of the\nSouth on Cemetery Ridge.\nThe banners waved there only for a moment. But that moment, brief as\nit was, recorded the high-water mark of the Confederacy.\nPickett’s charge – brilliant, heroic – was nevertheless the beginning of\nthe end. Lee had failed. He could not penetrate the North. And he knew it.\nThe South was doomed.\nLee was so saddened, so shocked, that he sent in his resignation and\nasked Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy, to appoint ‘a\nyounger and abler man.’ If Lee had wanted to blame the disastrous failure\nof Pickett’s charge on someone else, he could have found a score of alibis.\nSome of his division commanders had failed him. The cavalry hadn’t\narrived in time to support the infantry attack. This had gone wrong and that\nhad gone awry.\nBut Lee was far too noble to blame others. As Pickett’s beaten and\nbloody troops struggled back to the Confederate lines, Robert E. Lee rode\nout to meet them all alone and greeted them with a self-condemnation that\nwas little short of sublime. ‘All this has been my fault,’ he confessed. ‘I and\nI alone have lost this battle.’\nFew generals in all history have had the courage and character to admit\nthat.\nMichael Cheung, who teaches our course in Hong Kong, told of how\nthe Chinese culture presents some special problems and how sometimes it is\nnecessary to recognise that the benefit of applying a principle may be more\nadvantageous than maintaining an old tradition. He had one middle-aged\nclass member who had been estranged from his son for many years. The\nfather had been an opium addict, but was now cured. In Chinese tradition an\nolder person cannot take the first step. The father felt that it was up to his\nson to take the initiative toward a reconciliation. In an early session, he told\nthe class about the grandchildren he had never seen and how much he","desired to be reunited with his son. His classmates, all Chinese, understood\nhis conflict between his desire and long-established tradition. The father felt\nthat young people should have respect for their elders and that he was right\nin not giving in to his desire, but to wait for his son to come to him.\nToward the end of the course the father again addressed his class. ‘I\nhave pondered this problem,’ he said. ‘Dale Carnegie says, “If you are\nwrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.” It is too late for me to admit it\nquickly, but I can admit it emphatically. I wronged my son. He was right in\nnot wanting to see me and to expel me from his life. I may lose face by\nasking a younger person’s forgiveness, but I was at fault and it is my\nresponsibility to admit this.’ The class applauded and gave him their full\nsupport. At the next class he told how he went to his son’s house, asked for\nand received forgiveness and was now embarked on a new relationship with\nhis son, his daughter-in-law and the grandchildren he had at last met.\nElbert Hubbard was one of the most original authors who ever stirred\nup a nation, and his stinging sentences often aroused fierce resentment. But\nHubbard with his rare skill for handling people frequently turned his\nenemies into friends.\nFor example, when some irritated reader wrote in to say that he didn’t\nagree with such and such an article and ended by calling Hubbard this and\nthat, Elbert Hubbard would answer like this:\nCome to think it over, I don’t entirely agree with it myself. Not\neverything I wrote yesterday appeals to me today. I am glad to\nlearn what you think on the subject. The next time you are in the\nneighbourhood you must visit us and we’ll get this subject\nthreshed out for all time. So here is a handclasp over the miles,\nand I am,\nYours sincerely,\nWhat could you say to a man who treated you like that?\nWhen we are right, let’s try to win people gently and tactfully to our\nway of thinking, and when we are wrong – and that will be surprisingly\noften, if we are honest with ourselves – let’s admit our mistakes quickly and\nwith enthusiasm. Not only will that technique produce astonishing results;","but, believe it or not, it is a lot more fun, under the circumstances, than\ntrying to defend oneself.\nRemember the old proverb: ‘By fighting you never get enough, but by\nyielding you get more than you expected.’\nPRINCIPLE 3\nIf you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.","IF YOUR TEMPER is aroused and you tell ’em a thing or two, you will have a\nfine time unloading your feelings. But what about the other person? Will he\nshare your pleasure? Will your belligerent tones, your hostile attitude, make\nit easy for him to agree with you?\n‘If you come at me with your fists doubled,’ said Woodrow Wilson, ‘I\nthink I can promise you that mine will double as fast as yours; but if you\ncome to me and say, “Let us sit down and take counsel together, and, if we\ndiffer from each other, understand why it is that we differ, just what the\npoints at issue are,” we will presently find that we are not so far apart after\nall, that the points on which we differ are few and the points on which we\nagree are many, and that if we only have the patience and the candour and\nthe desire to get together, we will get together.’\nNobody appreciated the truth of Woodrow Wilson’s statement more\nthan John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Back in 1915, Rockefeller was the most\nfiercely despised man in Colorado. One of the bloodiest strikes in the\nhistory of American industry had been shocking the state for two terrible\nyears. Irate, belligerent miners were demanding higher wages from the\nColorado Fuel and Iron Company; Rockefeller controlled that company.\nProperty had been destroyed, troops had been called out. Blood had been\nshed. Strikers had been shot, their bodies riddled with bullets.\nAt a time like that, with the air seething with hatred, Rockefeller\nwanted to win the strikers to his way of thinking. And he did it. How?\nHere’s the story. After weeks spent in making friends, Rockefeller\naddressed the representatives of the strikers. This speech, in its entirety, is a\nmasterpiece. It produced astonishing results. It calmed the tempestuous\nwaves of hate that threatened to engulf Rockefeller. It won him a host of\nadmirers. It presented facts in such a friendly manner that the strikers went\nback to work without saying another word about the increase in wages for\nwhich they had fought so violently.","The opening of that remarkable speech follows. Note how it fairly\nglows with friendliness. Rockefeller, remember, was talking to men who, a\nfew days previously, had wanted to hang him by the neck to a sour apple\ntree; yet he couldn’t have been more gracious, more friendly if he had\naddressed a group of medical missionaries. His speech was radiant with\nsuch phrases as I am proud to be here, having visited in your homes, met\nmany of your wives and children, we meet here not as strangers, but as\nfriends … spirit of mutual friendship, our common interests, it is only by\nyour courtesy that I am here.\n‘This is a red-letter day in my life,’ Rockefeller began. ‘It is the first\ntime I have ever had the good fortune to meet the representatives of the\nemployees of this great company, its officers and superintendents, together,\nand I can assure you that I am proud to be here, and that I shall remember\nthis gathering as long as I live. Had this meeting been held two weeks ago, I\nshould have stood here a stranger to most of you, recognising a few faces.\nHaving had the opportunity last week of visiting all the camps in the\nsouthern coal field and of talking individually with practically all of the\nrepresentatives, except those who were away; having visited in your homes,\nmet many of your wives and children, we meet here not as strangers, but as\nfriends, and it is in that spirit of mutual friendship that I am glad to have\nthis opportunity to discuss with you our common interests.\n‘Since this is a meeting of the officers of the company and the\nrepresentatives of the employees, it is only by your courtesy that I am here,\nfor I am not so fortunate as to be either one or the other; and yet I feel that I\nam intimately associated with you men, for, in a sense, I represent both the\nstockholders and the directors.’\nIsn’t that a superb example of the fine art of making friends out of\nenemies?\nSuppose Rockefeller had taken a different tack. Suppose he had argued\nwith those miners and hurled devastating facts in their faces. Suppose he\nhad told them by his tones and insinuations that they were wrong. Suppose\nthat, by all the rules of logic, he had proved that they were wrong. What\nwould have happened? More anger would have been stirred up, more\nhatred, more revolt.\nIf a man’s heart is rankling with discord and ill feeling toward\nyou, you can’t win him to your way of thinking with all the logic","in Christendom. Scolding parents and domineering bosses and\nhusbands and nagging wives ought to realize that people don’t\nwant to change their minds. They can’t be forced or driven to\nagree with you or me. But they may possibly be led to, if we are\ngentle and friendly, ever so gentle and ever so friendly.\nLincoln said that, in effect, over a hundred years ago. Here are his words:\nIt is an old and true maxim that ‘a drop of honey catches\nmore flies than a gallon of gall.’ So with men, if you would\nwin a man to your cause, first convince him that you are his\nsincere friend. Therein is a drop of honey that catches his\nheart; which, say what you will, is the great high road to his\nreason.\nBusiness executives have learned that it pays to be friendly to strikers. For\nexample, when 2,500 employees in the White Motor Company’s plant\nstruck for higher wages and a union shop, Robert F. Black, then president of\nthe company, didn’t lose his temper and condemn and threaten and talk of\ntyranny and Communists. He actually praised the strikers. He published an\nadvertisement in the Cleveland papers, complimenting them on ‘the\npeaceful way in which they laid down their tools.’ Finding the strike pickets\nidle, he bought them a couple of dozen baseball bats and gloves and invited\nthem to play ball on vacant lots. For those who preferred bowling, he rented\na bowling alley.\nThis friendliness on Mr. Black’s part did what friendliness always\ndoes: it begot friendliness. So the strikers borrowed brooms, shovels, and\nrubbish carts, and began picking up matches, papers, cigarette stubs, and\ncigar butts around the factory. Imagine it! Imagine strikers tidying up the\nfactory grounds while battling for higher wages and recognition of the\nunion. Such an event had never been heard of before in the long,\ntempestuous history of American labour wars. That strike ended with a\ncompromise settlement within a week – ended without any ill feeling or\nrancour.\nDaniel Webster, who looked like a god and talked like Jehovah, was\none of the most successful advocates who ever pleaded a case; yet he\nushered in his most powerful arguments with such friendly remarks as: ‘It","will be for the jury to consider,’ ‘This may, perhaps, be worth thinking of,’\n‘Here are some facts that I trust you will not lose sight of,’ or ‘You, with\nyour knowledge of human nature, will easily see the significance of these\nfacts.’ No bulldozing. No high-pressure methods. No attempt to force his\nopinions on others. Webster used the soft-spoken, quiet, friendly approach,\nand it helped to make him famous.\nYou may never be called upon to settle a strike or address a jury, but\nyou may want to get your rent reduced. Will the friendly approach help you\nthen? Let’s see.\nO.L. Straub, an engineer, wanted to get his rent reduced. And he knew\nhis landlord was hard-boiled. ‘I wrote him,’ Mr. Straub said in a speech\nbefore the class, ‘notifying him that I was vacating my apartment as soon as\nmy lease expired. The truth was, I didn’t want to move. I wanted to stay if I\ncould get my rent reduced. But the situation seemed hopeless. Other tenants\nhad tried – and failed. Everyone told me that the landlord was extremely\ndifficult to deal with. But I said to myself, “I am studying a course in how\nto deal with people, so I’ll try it on him – and see how it works.”\n‘He and his secretary came to see me as soon as he got my letter. I met\nhim at the door with a friendly greeting. I fairly bubbled with good will and\nenthusiasm. I didn’t begin talking about how high the rent was. I began\ntalking about how much I liked his apartment house. Believe me, I was\n“hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise.” I complimented him on\nthe way he ran the building and told him I should like so much to stay for\nanother year but I couldn’t afford it.\n‘He had evidently never had such a reception from a tenant. He hardly\nknew what to make of it.\n‘Then he started to tell me his troubles. Complaining tenants. One had\nwritten him fourteen letters, some of them positively insulting. Another\nthreatened to break his lease unless the landlord kept the man on the floor\nabove from snoring. “What a relief it is,” he said, “to have a satisfied tenant\nlike you.” And then, without my even asking him to do it, he offered to\nreduce my rent a little. I wanted more, so I named the figure I could afford\nto pay, and he accepted without a word.\n‘As he was leaving, he turned to me and asked, “What decorating can I\ndo for you?”\n‘If I had tried to get the rent reduced by the methods the other tenants\nwere using, I am positive I should have met with the same failure they","encountered. It was the friendly, sympathetic, appreciative approach that\nwon.’\nDean Woodcock of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is the superintendent of a\ndepartment of the local electric company. His staff was called upon to repair\nsome equipment on top of a pole. This type of work had formerly been\nperformed by a different department and had only recently been transferred\nto Woodcock’s section. Although his people had been trained in the work,\nthis was the first time they had ever actually been called upon to do it.\nEverybody in the organisation was interested in seeing if and how they\ncould handle it. Mr. Woodcock, several of his subordinate managers, and\nmembers of other departments of the utility went to see the operation. Many\ncars and trucks were there, and a number of people were standing around\nwatching the two lone men on top of the pole.\nGlancing around, Woodcock noticed a man up the street getting out of\nhis car with a camera. He began taking pictures of the scene. Utility people\nare extremely conscious of public relations, and suddenly Woodcock\nrealised what this setup looked like to the man with the camera – overkill,\ndozens of people being called out to do a two-person job. He strolled up the\nstreet to the photographer.\n‘I see you’re interested in our operation.’\n‘Yes, and my mother will be more than interested. She owns stock in\nyour company. This will be an eye-opener for her. She may even decide her\ninvestment was unwise. I’ve been telling her for years there’s a lot of waste\nmotion in companies like yours. This proves it. The newspapers might like\nthese pictures, too.’\n‘It does look like it, doesn’t it? I’d think the same thing in your\nposition. But this is a unique situation . . . ‘ and Dean Woodcock went on to\nexplain how this was the first job of this type for his department and how\neverybody from executives down was interested. He assured the man that\nunder normal conditions two people could handle the job. The photographer\nput away his camera, shook Woodcock’s hand, and thanked him for taking\nthe time to explain the situation to him.\nDean Woodcock’s friendly approach saved his company much\nembarrassment and bad publicity.\nAnother member of one of our classes, Gerald H. Winn of Littleton,\nNew Hampshire, reported how by using a friendly approach, he obtained a\nvery satisfactory settlement on a damage claim.","‘Early in the spring,’ he reported, ‘before the ground had thawed from\nthe winter freezing, there was an unusually heavy rainstorm and the water,\nwhich normally would have run off to nearby ditches and storm drains\nalong the road, took a new course onto a building lot where I had just built a\nnew home.\n‘Not being able to run off, the water pressure built up around the\nfoundation of the house. The water forced itself under the concrete\nbasement floor, causing it to explode, and the basement filled with water.\nThis ruined the furnace and the hot-water heater. The cost to repair this\ndamage was in excess of two thousand dollars. I had no insurance to cover\nthis type of damage.\n‘However, I soon found out that the owner of the subdivision had\nneglected to put in a storm drain near the house which could have prevented\nthis problem. I made an appointment to see him. During the twenty-five-\nmile trip to his office, I carefully reviewed the situation and, remembering\nthe principles I learned in this course, I decided that showing my anger\nwould not serve any worthwhile purpose. When I arrived, I kept very calm\nand started by talking about his recent vacation to the West Indies; then,\nwhen I felt the timing was right, I mentioned the “little” problem of water\ndamage. He quickly agreed to do his share in helping to correct the\nproblem.\n‘A few days later he called and said he would pay for the damage and\nalso put in a storm drain to prevent the same thing from happening in the\nfuture.\n‘Even though it was the fault of the owner of the subdivision, if I had\nnot begun in a friendly way, there would have been a great deal of difficulty\nin getting him to agree to the total liability.’\nYears ago, when I was a barefoot boy walking through the woods to a\ncountry school out in northwest Missouri, I read a fable about the sun and\nthe wind. They quarrelled about which was the stronger, and the wind said,\n‘I’ll prove I am. See the old man down there with a coat? I bet I can get his\ncoat off him quicker than you can.’\nSo the sun went behind a cloud, and the wind blew until it was almost\na tornado, but the harder it blew, the tighter the old man clutched his coat to\nhim.\nFinally, the wind calmed down and gave up, and then the sun came out\nfrom behind the clouds and smiled kindly on the old man. Presently, he","mopped his brow and pulled off his coat. The sun then told the wind that\ngentleness and friendliness were always stronger than fury and force.\nThe use of gentleness and friendliness is demonstrated day after day by\npeople who have learned that a drop of honey catches more flies than a\ngallon of gall. F. Gale Connor of Lutherville, Maryland, proved this when\nhe had to take his four-month-old car to the service department of the car\ndealer for the third time. He told our class: ‘It was apparent that talking to,\nreasoning with or shouting at the service manager was not going to lead to a\nsatisfactory resolution of my problems.\n‘I walked over to the showroom and asked to see the agency owner,\nMr. White. After a short wait, I was ushered into Mr. White’s office. I\nintroduced myself and explained to him that I had bought my car from his\ndealership because of the recommendations of friends who had had\nprevious dealings with him. I was told that his prices were very competitive\nand his service was outstanding. He smiled with satisfaction as he listened\nto me. I then explained the problem I was having with the service\ndepartment. “I thought you might want to be aware of any situation that\nmight tarnish your fine reputation,” I added. He thanked me for calling this\nto his attention and assured me that my problem would be taken care of.\nNot only did he personally get involved, but he also lent me his car to use\nwhile mine was being repaired.’\nAesop was a Greek slave who lived at the court of Croesus and spun\nimmortal fables six hundred years before Christ. Yet the truths he taught\nabout human nature are just as true in Boston and Birmingham now as they\nwere twenty-six centuries ago in Athens. The sun can make you take off\nyour coat more quickly than the wind; and kindliness, the friendly approach\nand appreciation can make people change their minds more readily than all\nthe bluster and storming in the world.\nRemember what Lincoln said: ‘A drop of honey catches more flies\nthan a gallon of gall.’\nPRINCIPLE 4\nBegin in a friendly way.","IN TALKING WITH people, don’t begin by discussing the things on which you\ndiffer. Begin by emphasising – and keep on emphasising – the things on\nwhich you agree. Keep emphasising, if possible, that you are both striving\nfor the same end and that your only difference is one of method and not of\npurpose.\nGet the other person saying ‘Yes, yes’ at the outset. Keep your\nopponent, if possible, from saying ‘No.’\nA ‘No’ response, according to Professor Overstreet,\n1 is a most difficult\nhandicap to overcome. When you have said ‘No,’ all your pride of\npersonality demands that you remain consistent with yourself. You may\nlater feel that the ‘No’ was ill-advised; nevertheless, there is your precious\npride to consider! Once having said a thing, you feel you must stick to it.\nHence it is of the very greatest importance that a person be started in the\naffirmative direction.\nThe skilful speaker gets, at the outset, a number of ‘Yes’ responses.\nThis sets the psychological process of the listeners moving in the\naffirmative direction. It is like the movement of a billiard ball. Propel in one\ndirection, and it takes some force to deflect it; far more force to send it back\nin the opposite direction.\nThe psychological patterns here are quite clear. When a person says\n‘No’ and really means it, he or she is doing far more than saying a word of\ntwo letters. The entire organism – glandular, nervous, muscular – gathers\nitself together into a condition of rejection. There is, usually in minute but\nsometimes in observable degree, a physical withdrawal or readiness for\nwithdrawal. The whole neuromuscular system, in short, sets itself on guard\nagainst acceptance. When, to the contrary, a person says ‘Yes,’ none of the\nwithdrawal activities takes place. The organism is in a forward-moving,\naccepting, open attitude. Hence the more ‘Yeses’ we can, at the very outset,\ninduce, the more likely we are to succeed in capturing the attention for our\nultimate proposal.","It is a very simple technique – this yes response. And yet, how much it\nis neglected! It often seems as if people get a sense of their own importance\nby antagonising others at the outset.\nGet a student to say ‘No’ at the beginning, or a customer, child,\nhusband, or wife, and it takes the wisdom and the patience of angels to\ntransform that bristling negative into an affirmative.\nThe use of this ‘yes, yes’ technique enabled James Eberson, who was a\nteller in the Greenwich Savings Bank, in New York City, to secure a\nprospective customer who might otherwise have been lost.\n‘This man came in to open an account,’ said Mr. Eberson, ‘and I gave\nhim our usual form to fill out. Some of the questions he answered willingly,\nbut there were others he flatly refused to answer.\n‘Before I began the study of human relations, I would have told this\nprospective depositor that if he refused to give the bank this information,\nwe should have to refuse to accept this account. I am ashamed that I have\nbeen guilty of doing that very thing in the past. Naturally, an ultimatum like\nthat made me feel good. I had shown who was boss, that the bank’s rules\nand regulations couldn’t be flouted. But that sort of attitude certainly didn’t\ngive a feeling of welcome and importance to the man who had walked in to\ngive us his patronage.\n‘I resolved this morning to use a little horse sense. I resolved not to\ntalk about what the bank wanted but about what the customer wanted. And\nabove all else, I was determined to get him saying ‘yes, yes’ from the very\nstart. So I agreed with him. I told him the information he refused to give\nwas not absolutely necessary.\n‘“However,” I said, “suppose you have money in this bank at your\ndeath. Wouldn’t you like to have the bank transfer it to your next of kin,\nwho is entitled to it according to law?”\n‘“Yes, of course,” he replied.\n‘“Don’t you think,” I continued, “that it would be a good idea to give\nus the name of your next of kin so that, in the event of your death, we could\ncarry out your wishes without error or delay?”\n‘Again he said, “Yes.”\n‘The young man’s attitude softened and changed when he realised that\nwe weren’t asking for this information for our sake but for his sake. Before\nleaving the bank, this young man not only gave me complete information\nabout himself but he opened, at my suggestion, a trust account, naming his","mother as the beneficiary for his account, and he had gladly answered all\nthe questions concerning his mother also.\n‘I found that by getting him to say “yes, yes” from the outset, he forgot\nthe issue at stake and was happy to do all the things I suggested.’\nJoseph Allison, a sales representative for Westinghouse Electric\nCompany, had this story to tell: ‘There was a man in my territory that our\ncompany was most eager to sell to. My predecessor had called on him for\nten years without selling anything. When I took over the territory, I called\nsteadily for three years without getting an order. Finally, after thirteen years\nof calls and sales talk, we sold him a few motors. If these proved to be all\nright, an order for several hundred more would follow. Such was my\nexpectation.\n‘Right? I knew they would be all right. So when I called three weeks\nlater, I was in high spirits.\n‘The chief engineer greeted me with this shocking announcement:\n“Allison, I can’t buy the remainder of the motors from you.”\n‘“Why?” I asked in amazement. “Why?”\n‘“Because your motors are too hot. I can’t put my hand on them.”\n‘I knew it wouldn’t do any good to argue. I had tried that sort of thing\ntoo long. So I thought of getting the “yes, yes” response.\n‘“Well, now look, Mr. Smith,” I said. “I agree with you a hundred\npercent; if those motors are running too hot, you ought not to buy any more\nof them. You must have motors that won’t run any hotter than standards set\nby the National Electrical Manufacturers Association. Isn’t that so?’\n‘He agreed it was. I had gotten my first “yes.”\n‘“The Electrical Manufacturers Association regulations say that a\nproperly designed motor may have a temperature of 72 degrees Fahrenheit\nabove room temperature. Is that correct?”\n‘“Yes,” he agreed. “That’s quite correct. But your motors are much\nhotter.”\n‘I didn’t argue with him. I merely asked: “How hot is the mill room?”\n‘“Oh,” he said, “about 75 degrees Fahrenheit.”\n‘“Well,” I replied, “if the mill room is 75 degrees and you add 72 to\nthat, that makes a total of 147 degrees Fahrenheit. Wouldn’t you scald your\nhand if you held it under a spigot of hot water at a temperature of 147\ndegrees Fahrenheit?”\n‘Again he had to say “yes.”","‘“Well,” I suggested, “wouldn’t it be a good idea to keep your hands\noff those motors?”\n‘“Well, I guess you’re right,’ he admitted. We continued to chat for a\nwhile. Then he called his secretary and lined up approximately $35,000\nworth of business for the ensuing month.\n‘It took me years and cost me countless thousands of dollars in lost\nbusiness before I finally learned that it doesn’t pay to argue, that it is much\nmore profitable and much more interesting to look at things from the other\nperson’s viewpoint and try to get that person saying “yes, yes.”’\nEddie Snow, who sponsors our courses in Oakland, California, tells\nhow he became a good customer of a shop because the proprietor got him to\nsay ‘yes, yes.’ Eddie had become interested in bow hunting and had spent\nconsiderable money in purchasing equipment and supplies from a local bow\nstore. When his brother was visiting him he wanted to rent a bow for him\nfrom this store. The sales clerk told him they didn’t rent bows, so Eddie\nphoned another bow store. Eddie described what happened:\n‘A very pleasant gentleman answered the phone. His response to my\nquestion for a rental was completely different from the other place. He said\nhe was sorry but they no longer rented bows because they couldn’t afford to\ndo so. He then asked me if I had rented before. I replied, “Yes, several years\nago.” He reminded me that I probably paid $25 to $30 for the rental. I said\n“yes” again. He then asked if I was the kind of person who liked to save\nmoney. Naturally, I answered “yes.” He went on to explain that they had\nbow sets with all the necessary equipment on sale for $34.95. I could buy a\ncomplete set for only $4.95 more than I could rent one. He explained that is\nwhy they had discontinued renting them. Did I think that was reasonable?\nMy “yes” response led to a purchase of the set, and when I picked it up I\npurchased several more items at this shop and have since become a regular\ncustomer.’\nSocrates, ‘the gadfly of Athens,’ was one of the greatest philosophers\nthe world has ever known. He did something that only a handful of men in\nall history have been able to do: he sharply changed the whole course of\nhuman thought; and now, twenty-four centuries after his death, he is\nhonoured as one of the wisest persuaders who ever influenced this\nwrangling world.\nHis method? Did he tell people they were wrong? Oh, no, not Socrates.\nHe was far too adroit for that. His whole technique, now called the ‘Socratic","method,’ was based upon getting a ‘yes, yes’ response. He asked questions\nwith which his opponent would have to agree. He kept on winning one\nadmission after another until he had an armful of yeses. He kept on asking\nquestions until finally, almost without realising it, his opponents found\nthemselves embracing a conclusion they would have bitterly denied a few\nminutes previously.\nThe next time we are tempted to tell someone he or she is wrong, let’s\nremember old Socrates and ask a gentle question – a question that will get\nthe ‘yes, yes’ response.\nThe Chinese have a proverb pregnant with the age-old wisdom of the\nOrient: ‘He who treads softly goes far.’\nThey have spent five thousand years studying human nature, those\ncultured Chinese, and they have garnered a lot of perspicacity: ‘He who\ntreads softly goes far.’\nPRINCIPLE 5\nGet the other person saying ‘yes, yes’ immediately.\n1. Harry A. Overstreet, Influencing Human Behavior (New York: Norton, 1925).","MOST PEOPLE TRYING to win others to their way of thinking do too much\ntalking themselves. Let the other people talk themselves out. They know\nmore about their business and problems than you do. So ask them\nquestions. Let them tell you a few things.\nIf you disagree with them you may be tempted to interrupt. But don’t.\nIt is dangerous. They won’t pay attention to you while they still have a lot\nof ideas of their own crying for expression. So listen patiently and with an\nopen mind. Be sincere about it. Encourage them to express their ideas fully.\nDoes this policy pay in business? Let’s see. Here is the story of a sales\nrepresentative who was forced to try it.\nOne of the largest automobile manufacturers in the United States was\nnegotiating for a year’s requirements of upholstery fabrics. Three important\nmanufacturers had worked up fabrics in sample bodies. These had all been\ninspected by the executives of the motor company, and notice had been sent\nto each manufacturer saying that, on a certain day, a representative from\neach supplier would be given an opportunity to make a final plea for the\ncontract.\nG.B.R., a representative of one manufacturer, arrived in town with a\nsevere attack of laryngitis. ‘When it came my turn to meet the executives in\nconference,’ Mr. R – said as he related the story before one of my classes, ‘I\nhad lost my voice. I could hardly whisper. I was ushered into a room and\nfound myself face to face with the textile engineer, the purchasing agent,\nthe director of sales and the president of the company. I stood up and made\na valiant effort to speak, but I couldn’t do anything more than squeak.\n‘They were all seated around a table, so I wrote on a pad of paper:\n“Gentlemen, I have lost my voice. I am speechless.”\n‘“I’ll do the talking for you,” the president said. He did. He exhibited\nmy samples and praised their good points. A lively discussion arose about\nthe merits of my goods. And the president, since he was talking for me,","took the position I would have had during the discussion. My sole\nparticipation consisted of smiles, nods and a few gestures.\n‘As a result of this unique conference, I was awarded the contract,\nwhich called for over half a million yards of upholstery fabrics at an\naggregate value of $1,600,000 – the biggest order I had ever received.\n‘I know I would have lost the contract if I hadn’t lost my voice,\nbecause I had the wrong idea about the whole proposition. I discovered,\nquite by accident, how richly it sometimes pays to let the other person do\nthe talking.’\nLetting the other person do the talking helps in family situations as\nwell as in business. Barbara Wilson’s relationship with her daughter, Laurie,\nwas deteriorating rapidly. Laurie, who had been a quiet, complacent child,\nhad grown into an uncooperative, sometimes belligerent teenager. Mrs.\nWilson lectured her, threatened her and punished her, but all to no avail.\n‘One day,’ Mrs. Wilson told one of our classes, ‘I just gave up. Laurie\nhad disobeyed me and had left the house to visit her girl friend before she\nhad completed her chores. When she returned I was about to scream at her\nfor the ten-thousandth time, but I just didn’t have the strength to do it. I just\nlooked at her and said sadly, “Why, Laurie, Why?”\n‘Laurie noted my condition and in a calm voice asked, “Do you really\nwant to know?” I nodded and Laurie told me, first hesitantly, and then it all\nflowed out. I had never listened to her. I was always telling her to do this or\nthat. When she wanted to tell me her thoughts, feelings, ideas, I interrupted\nwith more orders. I began to realise that she needed me – not as a bossy\nmother, but as a confidante, an outlet for all her confusion about growing\nup. And all I had been doing was talking when I should have been listening.\nI never heard her.\n‘From that time on I let her do all the talking she wanted. She tells me\nwhat is on her mind, and our relationship has improved immeasurably. She\nis again a cooperative person.’\nA large advertisement appeared on the financial page of a New York\nnewspaper calling for a person with unusual ability and experience. Charles\nT. Cubellis answered the advertisement, sending his reply to a box number.\nA few days later, he was invited by letter to call for an interview. Before he\ncalled, he spent hours in Wall Street finding out everything possible about\nthe person who had founded the business. During the interview, he\nremarked: ‘I should be mighty proud to be associated with an organisation","with a record like yours. I understand you started twenty-eight years ago\nwith nothing but desk room and one stenographer. Is that true?’\nAlmost every successful person likes to reminisce about his early\nstruggles. This man was no exception. He talked for a long time about how\nhe had started with $450 in cash and an original idea. He told how he had\nfought against discouragement and battled against ridicule, working\nSundays and holidays, twelve to sixteen hours a day; how he had finally\nwon against all odds until now the most important executives on Wall Street\nwere coming to him for information and guidance. He was proud of such a\nrecord. He had a right to be, and he had a splendid time telling about it.\nFinally, he questioned Mr. Cubellis briefly about his experience, then called\nin one of his vice presidents and said: ‘I think this is the person we are\nlooking for.’\nMr. Cubellis had taken the trouble to find out about the\naccomplishments of his prospective employer. He showed an interest in the\nother person and his problems. He encouraged the other person to do most\nof the talking – and made a favourable impression.\nRoy G. Bradley of Sacramento, California, had the opposite problem.\nHe listened as a good prospect for a sales position talked himself into a job\nwith Bradley’s firm. Roy reported:\n‘Being a small brokerage firm, we had no fringe benefits, such as\nhospitalisation, medical insurance and pensions. Every representative is an\nindependent agent. We don’t even provide leads for prospects, as we cannot\nadvertise for them as our larger competitors do.\n‘Richard Pryor had the type of experience we wanted for this position,\nand he was interviewed first by my assistant, who told him about all the\nnegatives related to this job. He seemed slightly discouraged when he came\ninto my office. I mentioned the one benefit of being associated with my\nfirm, that of being an independent contractor and therefore virtually being\nself-employed.\n‘As he talked about these advantages to me, he talked himself out of\neach negative thought he had when he came in for the interview. Several\ntimes it seemed as though he was half talking to himself as he was thinking\nthrough each thought. At times I was tempted to add to his thoughts;\nhowever, as the interview came to a close I felt he had convinced himself\nvery much on his own that he would like to work for my firm.","‘Because I had been a good listener and let Dick do most of the\ntalking, he was able to weigh both sides fairly in his mind, and he came to\nthe positive conclusion, which was a challenge he created for himself. We\nhired him and he has been an outstanding representative for our firm.’\nEven our friends would much rather talk to us about their\nachievements than listen to us boast about ours.\nLa Rochefoucauld, the French philosopher, said: ‘If you want enemies,\nexcel your friends; but if you want friends, let your friends excel you.’\nWhy is that true? Because when our friends excel us, they feel\nimportant; but when we excel them, they – or at least some of them – will\nfeel inferior and envious.\nBy far the best-liked placement counsellor in the Midtown Personnel\nAgency in New York City was Henrietta G – . It hadn’t always been that\nway. During the first few months of her association with the agency,\nHenrietta didn’t have a single friend among her colleagues. Why? Because\nevery day she would brag about the placements she had made, the new\naccounts she had opened, and anything else she had accomplished.\n‘I was good at my work and proud of it,’ Henrietta told one of our\nclasses. ‘But instead of my colleagues sharing my triumphs, they seemed to\nresent them. I wanted to be liked by these people. I really wanted them to be\nmy friends. After listening to some of the suggestions made in this course, I\nstarted to talk about myself less and listen more to my associates. They also\nhad things to boast about and were more excited about telling me about\ntheir accomplishments than about listening to my boasting. Now, when we\nhave some time to chat, I ask them to share their joys with me, and I only\nmention my achievements when they ask.’\nPRINCIPLE 6","Let the other person do a great deal of the talking.","DON’T YOU HAVE much more faith in ideas that you discover for yourself\nthan in ideas that are handed to you on a silver platter? If so, isn’t it bad\njudgement to try to ram your opinions down the throats of other people?\nIsn’t it wiser to make suggestions – and let the other person think out the\nconclusion?\nAdolph Seltz of Philadelphia, sales manager in an automobile\nshowroom and a student in one of my courses, suddenly found himself\nconfronted with the necessity of injecting enthusiasm into a discouraged\nand disorganised group of automobile salespeople. Calling a sales meeting,\nhe urged his people to tell him exactly what they expected from him. As\nthey talked, he wrote their ideas on the blackboard. He then said: ‘I’ll give\nyou all these qualities you expect from me. Now I want you to tell me what\nI have a right to expect from you.’ The replies came quick and fast: loyalty,\nhonesty, initiative, optimism, teamwork, eight hours a day of enthusiastic\nwork. The meeting ended with a new courage, a new inspiration – one\nsalesperson volunteered to work fourteen hours a day – and Mr. Seltz\nreported to me that the increase of sales was phenomenal.\n‘The people had made a sort of moral bargain with me,’ said Mr. Seltz,\n‘and as long as I lived up to my part in it, they were determined to live up to\ntheirs. Consulting them about their wishes and desires was just the shot in\nthe arm they needed.’\nNo one likes to feel that he or she is being sold something or told to do\na thing. We much prefer to feel that we are buying of our own accord or\nacting on our own ideas. We like to be consulted about our wishes, our\nwants, our thoughts.\nTake the case of Eugene Wesson. He lost countless thousands of\ndollars in commissions before he learned this truth. Mr. Wesson sold\nsketches for a studio that created designs for stylists and textile\nmanufacturers. Mr. Wesson had called on one of the leading stylists in New\nYork once a week, every week for three years. ‘He never refused to see me,’","said Mr. Wesson, ‘but he never bought. He always looked over my sketches\nvery carefully and then said: “No, Wesson, I guess we don’t get together\ntoday.”’\nAfter 150 failures, Wesson realised he must be in a mental rut, so he\nresolved to devote one evening a week to the study of influencing human\nbehaviour, to help him develop new ideas and generate new enthusiasm.\nHe decided on this new approach. With half a dozen unfinished artists’\nsketches under his arm, he rushed over to the buyer’s office. ‘I want you to\ndo me a little favour, if you will,’ he said. ‘Here are some uncompleted\nsketches. Won’t you please tell me how we could finish them up in such a\nway that you could use them?’\nThe buyer looked at the sketches for a while without uttering a word.\nFinally he said: ‘Leave these with me for a few days, Wesson, and then\ncome back and see me.’\nWesson returned three days later, got his suggestions, took the sketches\nback to the studio and had them finished according to the buyer’s ideas. The\nresult? All accepted.\nAfter that, this buyer ordered scores of other sketches from Wesson, all\ndrawn according to the buyer’s ideas. ‘I realised why I had failed for years\nto sell him,’ said Mr. Wesson. ‘I had urged him to buy what I thought he\nought to have. Then I changed my approach completely. I urged him to give\nme his ideas. This made him feel that he was creating the designs. And he\nwas. I didn’t have to sell him. He bought.’\nLetting the other person feel that the idea is his or hers not only works\nin business and politics, it works in family life as well. Paul M. Davis of\nTulsa, Oklahoma, told his class how he applied this principle:\n‘My family and I enjoyed one of the most interesting sightseeing\nvacation trips we have ever taken. I had long dreamed of visiting such\nhistoric sites as the Civil War battlefield in Gettysburg, Independence Hall\nin Philadelphia, and our nation’s capital. Valley Forge, Jamestown and the\nrestored colonial village of Williamsburg were high on the list of things I\nwanted to see.\n‘In March my wife, Nancy, mentioned that she had ideas for our\nsummer vacation which included a tour of the western states, visiting points\nof interest in New Mexico, Arizona, California and Nevada. She had\nwanted to make this trip for several years. But we couldn’t obviously make\nboth trips.","‘Our daughter, Anne, had just completed a course in U.S. history in\njunior high school and had become very interested in the events that had\nshaped our country’s growth. I asked her how she would like to visit the\nplaces she had learned about on our next vacation. She said she would love\nto.\n‘Two evenings later as we sat around the dinner table, Nancy\nannounced that if we all agreed, the summer’s vacation would be to the\neastern states, that it would be a great trip for Anne and thrilling for all of\nus. We all concurred.’\nThis same psychology was used by an X-ray manufacturer to sell his\nequipment to one of the largest hospitals in Brooklyn. This hospital was\nbuilding an addition and preparing to equip it with the finest X-ray\ndepartment in America. Dr. L – , who was in charge of the X-ray\ndepartment, was overwhelmed with sales representatives, each caroling the\npraises of his own company’s equipment.\nOne manufacturer, however, was more skilful. He knew far more about\nhandling human nature than the others did. He wrote a letter something like\nthis:\nOur factory has recently completed a new line of X-ray\nequipment. The first shipment of these machines has just\narrived at our office. They are not perfect. We know that, and\nwe want to improve them. So we should be deeply obligated to\nyou if you could find time to look them over and give us your\nideas about how they can be made more serviceable to your\nprofession. Knowing how occupied you are, I shall be glad to\nsend my car for you at any hour you specify.\n‘I was surprised to get that letter,’ Dr. L – said as he related the incident\nbefore the class. ‘I was both surprised and complimented. I had never had\nan X-ray manufacturer seeking my advice before. It made me feel\nimportant. I was busy every night that week, but I cancelled a dinner\nappointment in order to look over the equipment. The more I studied it, the\nmore I discovered for myself how much I liked it.\n‘Nobody had tried to sell it to me. I felt that the idea of buying that\nequipment for the hospital was my own. I sold myself on its superior\nqualities and ordered it installed.’","Ralph Waldo Emerson in his essay ‘Self-Reliance’ stated: ‘In every\nwork of genius we recognise our own rejected thoughts; they come back to\nus with a certain alienated majesty.’\nColonel Edward M. House wielded an enormous influence in national\nand international affairs while Woodrow Wilson occupied the White House.\nWilson leaned upon Colonel House for secret counsel and advice more than\nhe did upon even members of his own cabinet.\nWhat method did the Colonel use in influencing the President?\nFortunately, we know, for House himself revealed it to Arthur D. Howden\nSmith, and Smith quoted House in an article in The Saturday Evening Post.\n‘“After I got to know the President,” House said, “I learned the best\nway to convert him to an idea was to plant it in his mind casually, but so as\nto interest him in it – so as to get him thinking about it on his own account.\nThe first time this worked it was an accident. I had been visiting him at the\nWhite House and urged a policy on him which he appeared to disapprove.\nBut several days later, at the dinner table, I was amazed to hear him trot out\nmy suggestion as his own.”’\nDid House interrupt him and say, ‘That’s not your idea. That’s mine’?\nOh, no. Not House. He was too adroit for that. He didn’t care about credit.\nHe wanted results. So he let Wilson continue to feel that the idea was his.\nHouse did even more than that. He gave Wilson public credit for these\nideas.\nLet’s remember that everyone we come in contact with is just as\nhuman as Woodrow Wilson. So let’s use Colonel House’s technique.\nA man up in the beautiful Canadian province of New Brunswick used\nthis technique on me and won my patronage. I was planning at the time to\ndo some fishing and canoeing in New Brunswick. So I wrote the tourist\nbureau for information. Evidently my name and address were put on a\nmailing list, for I was immediately overwhelmed with scores of letters and\nbooklets and printed testimonials from camps and guides. I was bewildered.\nI didn’t know which to choose. Then one camp owner did a clever thing. He\nsent me the names and telephone numbers of several New York people who\nhad stayed at his camp and he invited me to telephone them and discover\nfor myself what he had to offer.\nI found to my surprise that I knew one of the men on his list. I\ntelephoned him, found out what his experience had been, and then wired the\ncamp the date of my arrival.","The others had been trying to sell me on their service, but one let me\nsell myself. That organisation won.\nTwenty-five centuries ago, Lao-tse, a Chinese sage, said some things\nthat readers of this book might use today:\n‘The reason why rivers and seas receive the homage of a hundred\nmountain streams is that they keep below them. Thus they are able to reign\nover all the mountain streams. So the sage, wishing to be above men,\nputteth himself below them; wishing to be before them, he putteth himself\nbehind them. Thus, though his place be above men, they do not feel his\nweight; though his place be before them, they do not count it an injury.’\nPRINCIPLE 7\nLet the other person feel that the idea is his or hers.","REMEMBER THAT OTHER people may be totally wrong. But they don’t think\nso. Don’t condemn them. Any fool can do that. Try to understand them.\nOnly wise, tolerant, exceptional people even try to do that.\nThere is a reason why the other man thinks and acts as he does. Ferret\nout that reason – and you have the key to his actions, perhaps to his\npersonality.\nTry honestly to put yourself in his place.\nIf you say to yourself, ‘How would I feel, how would I react if I were\nin his shoes?’ you will save yourself time and irritation, for ‘by becoming\ninterested in the cause, we are less likely to dislike the effect.’ And, in\naddition, you will sharply increase your skill in human relationships.\n‘Stop a minute,’ says Kenneth M. Goode in his book How to Turn\nPeople Into Gold, ‘stop a minute to contrast your keen interest in your own\naffairs with your mild concern about anything else. Realise then, that\neverybody else in the world feels exactly the same way! Then, along with\nLincoln and Roosevelt, you will have grasped the only solid foundation for\ninterpersonal relationships; namely, that success in dealing with people\ndepends on a sympathetic grasp of the other person’s viewpoint.’\nSam Douglas of Hempstead, New York, used to tell his wife that she\nspent too much time working on their lawn, pulling weeds, fertilising,\ncutting the grass twice a week when the lawn didn’t look any better than it\nhad when they moved into their home four years earlier. Naturally, she was\ndistressed by his remarks, and each time he made such remarks the balance\nof the evening was ruined.\nAfter taking our course, Mr. Douglas realised how foolish he had been\nall those years. It never occurred to him that she enjoyed doing that work\nand she might really appreciate a compliment on her diligence.\nOne evening after dinner, his wife said she wanted to pull some weeds\nand invited him to keep her company. He first declined, but then thought","better of it and went out after her and began to help her pull weeds. She was\nvisibly pleased, and together they spent an hour in hard work and pleasant\nconversation.\nAfter that he often helped her with the gardening and complimented\nher on how fine the lawn looked, what a fantastic job she was doing with a\nyard where the soil was like concrete. Result: a happier life for both\nbecause he had learned to look at things from her point of view – even if the\nsubject was only weeds.\nIn his book Getting Through to People, Dr. Gerald S. Nirenberg\ncommented: ‘Cooperativeness in conversation is achieved when you show\nthat you consider the other person’s ideas and feelings as important as your\nown. Starting your conversation by giving the other person the purpose or\ndirection of your conversation, governing what you say by what you would\nwant to hear if you were the listener, and accepting his or her viewpoint will\nencourage the listener to have an open mind to your ideas.’\n1\nI have always enjoyed walking and riding in a park near my home.\nLike the Druids of ancient Gaul, I all but worship an oak tree, so I was\ndistressed season after season to see the young trees and shrubs killed off by\nneedless fires. These fires weren’t caused by careless smokers. They were\nalmost all caused by youngsters who went out to the park to go native and\ncook a frankfurter or an egg under the trees. Sometimes, these fires raged so\nfiercely that the fire department had to be called out to fight the\nconflagration.\nThere was a sign on the edge of the park saying that anyone who\nstarted a fire was liable to fine and imprisonment, but the sign stood in an\nunfrequented part of the park, and few of the culprits ever saw it. A\nmounted policeman was supposed to look after the park; but he didn’t take\nhis duties too seriously, and the fires continued to spread season after\nseason. On one occasion, I rushed up to a policeman and told him about a\nfire spreading rapidly through the park and wanted him to notify the fire\ndepartment, and he nonchalantly replied that it was none of his business\nbecause it wasn’t in his precinct! I was desperate, so after that when I went\nriding, I acted as a self-appointed committee of one to protect the public\ndomain. In the beginning, I am afraid I didn’t even attempt to see the other\npeople’s point of view. When I saw a fire blazing under the trees, I was so\nunhappy about it, so eager to do the right thing, that I did the wrong thing. I\nwould ride up to the boys, warn them that they could be jailed for starting a","fire, order with a tone of authority that it be put out; and, if they refused, I\nwould threaten to have them arrested. I was merely unloading my feelings\nwithout thinking of their point of view.\nThe result? They obeyed – obeyed sullenly and with resentment. After\nI rode on over the hill, they probably rebuilt the fire and longed to burn up\nthe whole park.\nWith the passing of the years, I acquired a trifle more knowledge of\nhuman relations, a little more tact, a somewhat greater tendency to see\nthings from the other person’s standpoint. Then, instead of giving orders, I\nwould ride up to a blazing fire and begin something like this:\n‘Having a good time, boys? What are you going to cook for supper? . .\n. I loved to build fires myself when I was a boy – and I still love to. But you\nknow they are dangerous here in the park. I know you boys don’t mean to\ndo any harm, but other boys aren’t so careful. They come along and see that\nyou have built a fire; so they build one and don’t put it out when they go\nhome and it spreads among the dry leaves and kills the trees. We won’t have\nany trees here at all if we aren’t more careful. You could be put in jail for\nbuilding this fire. But I don’t want to be bossy and interfere with your\npleasure. I like to see you enjoy yourselves; but won’t you please rake all\nthe leaves away from the fire right now – and you’ll be careful to cover it\nwith dirt, a lot of dirt, before you leave, won’t you? And the next time you\nwant to have some fun, won’t you please build your fire over the hill there\nin the sandpit? It can’t do any harm there . . . Thanks so much boys. Have a\ngood time.’\nWhat a difference that kind of talk made! It made the boys want to\ncooperate. No sullenness, no resentment. They hadn’t been forced to obey\norders. They had saved their faces. They felt better and I felt better because\nI had handled the situation with consideration for their point of view.\nSeeing things through another person’s eyes may ease tensions when\npersonal problems become overwhelming. Elizabeth Novak of New South\nWales, Australia, was six weeks late with her car payment. ‘On a Friday,’\nshe reported, ‘I received a nasty phone call from the man who was handling\nmy account informing me that if I did not come up with $122 by Monday\nmorning I could anticipate further action from the company. I had no way\nof raising the money over the weekend, so when I received his phone call\nfirst thing on Monday morning I expected the worst. Instead of becoming\nupset, I looked at the situation from his point of view. I apologised most","sincerely for causing him so much inconvenience and remarked that I must\nbe his most troublesome customer as this was not the first time I was behind\nin my payments. His tone of voice changed immediately, and he reassured\nme that I was far from being one of his really troublesome customers. He\nwent on to tell me several examples of how rude his customers sometimes\nwere, how they lied to him and often tried to avoid talking to him at all. I\nsaid nothing. I listened and let him pour out his troubles to me. Then,\nwithout any suggestion from me, he said it did not matter if I couldn’t pay\nall the money immediately. It would be all right if I paid him $20 by the end\nof the month and made up the balance whenever it was convenient for me\nto do so.’\nTomorrow, before asking anyone to put out a fire or buy your product\nor contribute to your favourite charity, why not pause and close your eyes\nand try to think the whole thing through from another person’s point of\nview.? Ask yourself: ‘Why should he or she want to do it?’ True, this will\ntake time, but it will avoid making enemies and will get better results – and\nwith less friction and less shoe leather.\n‘I would rather walk the sidewalk in front of a person’s office for two\nhours before an interview,’ said Dean Donham of the Harvard business\nschool, ‘than step into that office without a perfectly clear idea of what I\nwas going to say and what that person – from my knowledge of his or her\ninterests and motives – was likely to answer.’\nThat is so important that I am going to repeat it in italics for the sake\nof emphasis.","I would rather walk the sidewalk in front of a person’s office for two\nhours before an interview than step into that office without a perfectly clear\nidea of what I was going to say and what that person – from my knowledge\nof his or her interests and motives – was likely to answer.\nIf, as a result of reading this book, you get only one thing – an\nincreased tendency to think always in terms of the other person’s point of\nview, and see things from that person’s angle, as well as your own – if you\nget only one thing from this book, it may easily prove to be one of the\nstepping-stones of your career.\nPRINCIPLE 8\nTry honestly to see things from the other person’s point of view.\n1. Dr. Gerald S. Nirenberg, Getting Through to People (Englewood Cliffs, N.J. Prentice-Hall, 1963),\np. 31.","WOULDN’T YOU LIKE to have a magic phrase that would stop arguments,\neliminate ill feeling, create good will, and make the other person listen\nattentively?\nYes? All right. Here it is: ‘I don’t blame you one iota for feeling as you\ndo. If I were you I would undoubtedly feel just as you do.’\nAn answer like that will soften the most cantankerous old cuss alive.\nAnd you can say that and be 100 percent sincere, because if you were the\nother person you, of course, would feel just as he does. Take Al Capone, for\nexample. Suppose you had inherited the same body and temperament and\nmind that Al Capone had. Suppose you had his environment and\nexperiences. You would then be precisely what he was – and where he was.\nFor it is those things – and only those things – that made him what he was.\nThe only reason, for example, that you are not a rattlesnake is that your\nmother and father weren’t rattlesnakes.\nYou deserve very little credit for being what you are – and remember,\nthe people who come to you irritated, bigoted, unreasoning, deserve very\nlittle discredit for being what they are. Feel sorry for the poor devils. Pity\nthem. Sympathise with them. Say to yourself: ‘There, but for the grace of\nGod, go I.’\nThree-fourths of the people you will ever meet are hungering and\nthirsting for sympathy. Give it to them, and they will love you.\nI once gave a broadcast about the author of Little Women, Louisa May\nAlcott. Naturally, I knew she had lived and written her immortal books in\nConcord, Massachusetts. But, without thinking what I was saying, I spoke\nof visiting her old home in Concord, New Hampshire. If I had said New\nHampshire only once, it might have been forgiven. But, alas and alack! I\nsaid it twice. I was deluged with letters and telegrams, stinging messages\nthat swirled around my defenceless head like a swarm of hornets. Many\nwere indignant. A few insulting. One Colonial Dame, who had been reared\nin Concord, Massachusetts, and who was then living in Philadelphia, vented","her scorching wrath upon me. She couldn’t have been much more bitter if I\nhad accused Miss Alcott of being a cannibal from New Guinea. As I read\nthe letter, I said to myself, ‘Thank God, I am not married to that woman.’ I\nfelt like writing and telling her that although I had made a mistake in\ngeography, she had made a far greater mistake in common courtesy. That\nwas to be just my opening sentence. Then I was going to roll up my sleeves\nand tell her what I really thought. But I didn’t. I controlled myself. I\nrealised that any hotheaded fool could do that – and that most fools would\ndo just that.\nI wanted to be above fools. So I resolved to try to turn her hostility into\nfriendliness. It would be a challenge, a sort of game I could play. I said to\nmyself, ‘After all, if I were she, I would probably feel just as she does.’ So,\nI determined to sympathise with her viewpoint. The next time I was in\nPhiladelphia, I called her on the telephone. The conversation went\nsomething like this:","So, because I had apologised and sympathised with her point of view, she\nbegan apologising and sympathising with my point of view. I had the\nsatisfaction of controlling my temper, the satisfaction of returning kindness\nfor an insult. I got infinitely more fun out of making her like me than I\ncould ever have gotten out of telling her to go and take a jump in the\nShuylkill River.\nEvery man who occupies the White House is faced almost daily with\nthorny problems in human relations. President Taft was no exception, and\nhe learned from experience the enormous chemical value of sympathy in\nneutralising the acid of hard feelings. In his book Ethics in Service, Taft","gives rather an amusing illustration of how he softened the ire of a\ndisappointed and ambitious mother.\n‘A lady in Washington,’ wrote Taft, ‘whose husband had some\npolitical influence, came and laboured with me for six weeks or more to\nappoint her son to a position. She secured the aid of Senators and\nCongressmen in formidable number and came with them to see that they\nspoke with emphasis. The place was one requiring technical qualification,\nand following the recommendation of the head of the Bureau, I appointed\nsomebody else. I then received a letter from the mother, saying that I was\nmost ungrateful, since I declined to make her a happy woman as I could\nhave done by a turn of my hand. She complained further that she had\nlaboured with her state delegation and got all the votes for an administration\nbill in which I was especially interested and this was the way I had\nrewarded her.\n‘When you get a letter like that, the first thing you do is to think how\nyou can be severe with a person who has committed an impropriety, or even\nbeen a little impertinent. Then you may compose an answer. Then if you are\nwise, you will put the letter in a drawer and lock the drawer. Take it out in\nthe course of two days – such communications will always bear two days’\ndelay in answering – and when you take it out after that interval, you will\nnot send it. That is just the course I took. After that, I sat down and wrote\nher just as polite a letter as I could, telling her I realised a mother’s\ndisappointment under such circumstances, but that really the appointment\nwas not left to my mere personal preference, that I had to select a man with\ntechnical qualifications, and had, therefore, to follow the recommendations\nof the head of the Bureau. I expressed the hope that her son would go on to\naccomplish what she had hoped for him in the position which he then had.\nThat mollified her and she wrote me a note saying she was sorry she had\nwritten as she had.\n‘But the appointment I sent in was not confirmed at once, and after an\ninterval I received a letter which purported to come from her husband,\nthough it was in the same handwriting as all the others. I was therein\nadvised that, due to the nervous prostration that had followed her\ndisappointment in this case, she had to take to her bed and had developed a\nmost serious case of cancer of the stomach. Would I not restore her to\nhealth by withdrawing the first name and replacing it by her son’s? I had to\nwrite another letter, this one to the husband, to say that I hoped the","diagnosis would prove to be inaccurate, that I sympathised with him in the\nsorrow he must have in the serious illness of his wife, but that it was\nimpossible to withdraw the name sent in. The man whom I appointed was\nconfirmed, and within two days after I received that letter, we gave a\nmusicale at the White House. The first two people to greet Mrs. Taft and me\nwere this husband and wife, though the wife had so recently been in\narticulo mortis.’\nJay Mangum represented an elevator-escalator maintenance company\nin Tulsa, Oklahoma, which had the maintenance contract for the escalators\nin one of Tulsa’s leading hotels. The hotel manager did not want to shut\ndown the escalator for more than two hours at a time because he did not\nwant to inconvenience the hotel’s guests. The repair that had to be made\nwould take at least eight hours, and his company did not always have a\nspecially qualified mechanic available at the convenience of the hotel.\nWhen Mr. Mangum was able to schedule a top-flight mechanic for this\njob, he telephoned the hotel manager and instead of arguing with him to\ngive him the necessary time he said:\n‘Rick, I know your hotel is quite busy and you would like to keep the\nescalator shutdown time to a minimum. I understand your concern about\nthis, and we want to do everything possible to accommodate you. However,\nour diagnosis of the situation shows that if we do not do a complete job\nnow, your escalator may suffer more serious damage and that would cause a\nmuch longer shutdown. I know you would not want to inconvenience your\nguests for several days.’\nThe manager had to agree that an eight-hour shutdown was more\ndesirable than several days’. By sympathising with the manager’s desire to\nkeep his patrons happy, Mr. Mangum was able to win the hotel manager to\nhis way of thinking easily and without rancour.\nJoyce Norris, a piano teacher in St. Louis, Missouri, told of how she\nhad handled a problem piano teachers often have with teenage girls. Babette\nhad exceptionally long fingernails.\nThis is a serious handicap to anyone who wants to develop proper\npiano-playing habits.\nMrs Norris reported: ‘I knew her long fingernails would be a barrier\nfor her in her desire to play well. During our discussion prior to her starting\nher lessons with me, I did not mention anything to her about her nails. I\ndidn’t want to discourage her from taking lessons, and I also knew she","would not want to lose that which she took so much pride in and such great\ncare to make attractive.\n‘After her first lesson, when I felt the time was right, I said: “Babette,\nyou have attractive hands and beautiful fingernails. If you want to play the\npiano as well as you are capable of and as well as you would like to, you\nwould be surprised how much quicker and easier it would be for you, if you\nwould trim your nails shorter. Just think about it, okay?” She made a face\nwhich was definitely negative. I also talked to her mother about this\nsituation, again mentioning how lovely her nails were. Another negative\nreaction. It was obvious that Babette’s beautifully manicured nails were\nimportant to her.\n‘The following week Babette returned for her second lesson. Much to\nmy surprise, the fingernails had been trimmed. I complimented her and\npraised her for making such a sacrifice. I also thanked her mother for\ninfluencing Babette to cut her nails. Her reply was “Oh, I had nothing to do\nwith it. Babette decided to do it on her own, and this is the first time she has\never trimmed her nails for anyone.”’\nDid Mrs Norris threaten Babette? Did she say she would refuse to\nteach a student with long fingernails? No, she did not. She let Babette know\nthat her fingernails were a thing of beauty and it would be a sacrifice to cut\nthem. She implied, ‘I sympathise with you – I know it won’t be easy, but it\nwill pay off in your better musical development.’\nSol Hurok was probably America’s number one impresario. For almost\nhalf a century he handled artists – such world-famous artists as Chaliapin,\nIsadora Duncan, and Pavlova. Mr. Hurok told me that one of the first\nlessons he had learned in dealing with his temperamental stars was the\nnecessity for sympathy, sympathy and more sympathy with their\nidiosyncrasies.\nFor three years, he was impresario for Feodor Chaliapin – one of the\ngreatest bassos who ever thrilled the ritzy boxholders at the Metropolitan.\nYet Chaliapin was a constant problem. He carried on like a spoiled child. To\nput it in Mr. Hurok’s own inimitable phrase: ‘He was a hell of a fellow in\nevery way.’\nFor example, Chaliapin would call up Mr. Hurok about noon of the\nday he was going to sing and say, ‘Sol, I feel terrible. My throat is like raw\nhamburger. It is impossible for me to sing tonight.’ Did Mr. Hurok argue\nwith him? Oh, no. He knew that an entrepreneur couldn’t handle artists that","way. So he would rush over to Chaliapin’s hotel, dripping with sympathy.\n‘What a pity,’ he would mourn. ‘What a pity! My poor fellow. Of course,\nyou cannot sing. I will cancel the engagement at once. It will only cost you\na couple of thousand dollars, but that is nothing in comparison to your\nreputation.’\nThen Chaliapin would sigh and say, ‘Perhaps you had better come over\nlater in the day. Come at five and see how I feel then.’\nAt five o’clock, Mr. Hurok would again rush to his hotel, dripping with\nsympathy. Again he would insist on cancelling the engagement and again\nChaliapin would sigh and say, ‘Well, maybe you had better come to see me\nlater. I may be better then.’\nAt seven-thirty the great basso would consent to sing, only with the\nunderstanding that Mr. Hurok would walk out on the stage of the\nMetropolitan and announce that Chaliapin had a very bad cold and was not\nin good voice. Mr. Hurok would lie and say he would do it, for he knew that\nwas the only way to get the basso out on the stage.\nDr. Arthur I. Gates said in his splendid book Educational Psychology:\n‘Sympathy the human species universally craves. The child eagerly displays\nhis injury; or even inflicts a cut or bruise in order to reap abundant\nsympathy. For the same purpose adults . . . show their bruises, relate their\naccidents, illness, especially details of surgical operations. “Self-pity” for\nmisfortunes real or imaginary is, in some measure, practically a universal\npractice.’\nSo, if you want to win people to your way of thinking, put in practice .\n. .\nPRINCIPLE 9\nBe sympathetic with the other person’s ideas and desires.","I WAS REARED on the edge of the Jesse James country out in Missouri, and I\nvisited the James farm at Kearney, Missouri, where the son of Jesse James\nwas then living.\nHis wife told me stories of how Jesse robbed trains and held up banks\nand then gave money to the neighbouring farmers to pay off their\nmortgages.\nJesse James probably regarded himself as an idealist at heart, just as\nDutch Schultz, ‘Two Gun’ Crowley, Al Capone and many other organised\ncrime ‘godfathers’ did generations later. The fact is that all people you meet\nhave a high regard for themselves and like to be fine and unselfish in their\nown estimation.\nJ. Pierpont Morgan observed, in one of his analytical interludes, that a\nperson usually has two reasons for doing a thing: one that sounds good and\na real one.\nThe person himself will think of the real reason. You don’t need to\nemphasise that. But all of us, being idealists at heart, like to think of\nmotives that sound good. So, in order to change people, appeal to the nobler\nmotives.\nIs that too idealistic to work in business? Let’s see. Let’s take the case\nof Hamilton J. Farrell of the Farrell-Mitchell Company of Glenolden,\nPennsylvania. Mr. Farrell had a disgruntled tenant who threatened to move.\nThe tenant’s lease still had four months to run; nevertheless, he served\nnotice that he was vacating immediately, regardless of lease.\n‘These people had lived in my house all winter – the most expensive\npart of the year,’ Mr. Farrell said as he told the story to the class, ‘and I\nknew it would be difficult to rent the apartment again before fall. I could\nsee all that rent income going over the hill and believe me, I saw red.\n‘Now, ordinarily, I would have waded into that tenant and advised him\nto read his lease again. I would have pointed out that if he moved, the full","balance of his rent would fall due at once – and that I could, and would\nmove to collect.\n‘However, instead of flying off the handle and making a scene, I\ndecided to try other tactics. So I started like this: “Mr. Doe,” I said, “I have\nlistened to your story, and I still don’t believe you intend to move. Years in\nthe renting business have taught me something about human nature, and I\nsized you up in the first place as being a man of your word. In fact, I’m so\nsure of it that I’m willing to take a gamble.\n‘“Now, here’s my proposition. Lay your decision on the table for a few\ndays and think it over. If you come back to me between now and the first of\nthe month, when your rent is due, and tell me you still intend to move, I\ngive you my word I will accept your decision as final. I will privilege you\nto move and admit to myself I’ve been wrong in my judgement. But I still\nbelieve you’re a man of your word and will live up to your contract. For\nafter all, we are either men or monkeys – and the choice usually lies with\nourselves!’\n‘Well, when the new month came around, this gentleman came to see\nme and paid his rent in person. He and his wife had talked it over, he said –\nand decided to stay. They had concluded that the only honourable thing to\ndo was to live up to their lease.’\nWhen the late Lord Northcliffe found a newspaper using a picture of\nhim which he didn’t want published, he wrote the editor a letter. But did he\nsay, ‘Please do not publish that picture of me any more; I don’t like it’? No,\nhe appealed to a nobler motive. He appealed to the respect and love that all\nof us have for motherhood. He wrote, ‘Please do not publish that picture of\nme any more. My mother doesn’t like it.’\nWhen John D. Rockefeller, Jr., wished to stop newspaper\nphotographers from snapping pictures of his children, he too appealed to the\nnobler motives. He didn’t say: ‘I don’t want their pictures published.’ No,\nhe appealed to the desire, deep in all of us, to refrain from harming children.\nHe said: ‘You know how it is, boys. You’ve got children yourselves, some\nof you. And you know it’s not good for youngsters to get too much\npublicity.’\nWhen Cyrus H.K. Curtis, the poor boy from Maine, was starting on his\nmeteoric career, which was destined to make him millions as owner of The\nSaturday Evening Post and the Ladies’ Home Journal, he couldn’t afford to\npay his contributors the prices that other magazines paid. He couldn’t afford","to hire first-class authors to write for money alone. So he appealed to their\nnobler motives. For example, he persuaded even Louisa May Alcott, the\nimmortal author of Little Women, to write for him when she was at the flood\ntide of her fame; and he did it by offering to send a cheque for a hundred\ndollars, not to her, but to her favourite charity.\nRight here the sceptic may say: ‘Oh, that stuff is all right for\nNorthcliffe and Rockefeller or a sentimental novelist. But, I’d like to see\nyou make it work with the tough babies I have to collect bills from!’\nYou may be right. Nothing will work in all cases – and nothing will\nwork with all people. If you are satisfied with the results you are now\ngetting, why change? If you are not satisfied, why not experiment?\nAt any rate, I think you will enjoy reading this true story told by James\nL. Thomas, a former student of mine:\nSix customers of a certain automobile company refused to pay their\nbills for servicing. None of the customers protested the entire bill, but each\nclaimed that some one charge was wrong. In each case, the customer had\nsigned for the work done, so the company knew it was right – and said so.\nThat was the first mistake.\nHere are the steps the men in the credit department took to collect\nthese overdue bills. Do you suppose they succeeded?\n1 They called on each customer and told him bluntly that they had\ncome to collect a bill that was long past due.\n2 They made it very plain that the company was absolutely and\nunconditionally right; therefore he, the customer, was absolutely and\nunconditionally wrong.\n3 They intimated that they, the company, knew more about automobiles\nthan he could ever hope to know. So what was the argument about?\n4 Result: They argued.\nDid any of these methods reconcile the customer and settle the account?\nYou can answer that one yourself.\nAt this stage of affairs the credit manager was about to open fire with a\nbattery of legal talent, when fortunately the matter came to the attention of\nthe general manager. The manager investigated these defaulting clients and\ndiscovered that they all had the reputation of paying their bills promptly.\nSomething was drastically wrong about the method of collection. So he","called in James L. Thomas and told him to collect these ‘uncollectible’\naccounts.\nHere, in his own words, are the steps Mr. Thomas took:\n1 My visit to each customer was likewise to collect a bill long past due\n– a bill that we knew was absolutely right. But I didn’t say a word\nabout that. I explained I had called to find out what it was the\ncompany had done, or failed to do.\n2 I made it clear that, until I had heard the customer’s story, I had no\nopinion to offer. I told him the company made no claims to being\ninfallible.\n3 I told him I was interested only in his car, and that he knew more\nabout his car than anyone else in the world; that he was the authority\non the subject.\n4 I let him talk, and I listened to him with all the interest and sympathy\nthat he wanted – and had expected.\n5 Finally, when the customer was in a reasonable mood, I put the\nwhole thing up to his sense of fair play. I appealed to the nobler\nmotives. ‘First,’ I said, ‘I want you to know I also feel that this matter\nhas been badly mishandled. You’ve been inconvenienced and annoyed\nand irritated by one of our representatives. That should never have\nhappened. I’m sorry and, as a representative of the company, I\napologise. As I sat here and listened to your side of the story, I could\nnot help being impressed by your fairness and patience. And now,\nbecause you are fair-minded and patient, I am going to ask you to do\nsomething for me. It’s something that you can do better than anyone\nelse, something you know more about than anyone else. Here is your\nbill; I know it is safe for me to ask you to adjust it, just as you would\ndo if you were the president of my company. I am going to leave it all\nup to you. Whatever you say goes.’\nDid he adjust the bill? He certainly did, and got quite a kick\nout of it. The bills ranged from $150 to $400 – but did the\ncustomer give himself the best of it? Yes, one of them did! One of\nthem refused to pay a penny of the disputed charge; but the other\nfive all gave the company the best of it! And here’s the cream of\nthe whole thing: we delivered new cars to all six of these\ncustomers within the next two years!","‘Experience has taught me,’ says Mr. Thomas, ‘That when no information\ncan be secured about the customer, the only sound basis on which to\nproceed is to assume that he or she is sincere, honest, truthful and willing\nand anxious to pay the charges, once convinced they are correct. To put it\ndifferently and perhaps more clearly, people are honest and want to\ndischarge their obligations. The exceptions to that rule are comparatively\nfew, and I am convinced that the individuals who are inclined to chisel will\nin most cases react favourably if you make them feel that you consider them\nhonest, upright and fair.’\nPRINCIPLE 10\nAppeal to the nobler motives.","MANY YEARS AGO, the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin was being maligned by\na dangerous whispering campaign. A malicious rumour was being\ncirculated. Advertisers were being told that the newspaper was no longer\nattractive to readers because it carried too much advertising and too little\nnews. Immediate action was necessary. The gossip had to be squelched.\nBut how?\nThis is the way it was done.\nThe Bulletin clipped from its regular edition all reading matter of all\nkinds on one average day, classified it, and published it as a book. The book\nwas called One Day. It contained 307 pages – as many as a hard-covered\nbook; yet the Bulletin had printed all this news and feature material on one\nday and sold it, not for several dollars, but for a few cents.\nThe printing of that book dramatised the fact that the Bulletin carried\nan enormous amount of interesting reading matter. It conveyed the facts\nmore vividly, more interestingly, more impressively, than pages of figures\nand mere talk could have done.\nThis is the day of dramatisation. Merely stating a truth isn’t enough.\nThe truth has to be made vivid, interesting, dramatic. You have to use\nshowmanship. The movies do it. Television does it. And you will have to do\nit if you want attention.\nExperts in window display know the power of dramatisation. For\nexample the manufacturers of a new rat poison gave dealers a window\ndisplay that included two live rats. The week the rats were shown, sales\nzoomed to five times their normal rate.\nTelevision commercials abound with examples of the use of dramatic\ntechniques in selling products. Sit down one evening in front of your\ntelevision set and analyse what the advertisers do in each of their\npresentations. You will note how an antacid medicine changes the colour of","the acid in a test tube while its competitor doesn’t, how one brand of soap\nor detergent gets a greasy shirt clean when the other brand leaves it grey.\nYou’ll see a car manoeuvre around a series of turns and curves – far better\nthan just being told about it. Happy faces will show contentment with a\nvariety of products. All of these dramatise for the viewer the advantages\noffered by whatever is being sold – and they do get people to buy them.\nYou can dramatise your ideas in business or in any other aspect of your\nlife. It’s easy. Jim Yeamans, who sells for the NCR company (National Cash\nRegister) in Richmond, Virginia, told how he made a sale by dramatic\ndemonstration.\n‘Last week I called on a neighbourhood grocer and saw that the cash\nregisters he was using at his checkout counters were very old-fashioned. I\napproached the owner and told him: “You are literally throwing away\npennies every time a customer goes through your line.” With that I threw a\nhandful of pennies on the floor. He quickly became more attentive. The\nmere words should have been of interest to him, but the sound of pennies\nhitting the floor really stopped him. I was able to get an order from him to\nreplace all of his old machines.’\nIt works in home life as well. When the old-time lover proposed to his\nsweetheart, did he just use words of love? No! He went down on his knees.\nThat really showed he meant what he said. We don’t propose on our knees\nany more, but many suitors still set up a romantic atmosphere before they\npop the question.\nDramatising what you want works with children as well. Joe B. Fant,\nJr., of Birmingham, Alabama, was having difficulty getting his five-year-\nold boy and three-year-old daughter to pick up their toys, so he invented a\n‘train.’ Joey was the engineer (Captain Casey Jones) on his tricycle. Janet’s\nwagon was attached, and in the evening she loaded all the ‘coal’ on the\ncaboose (her wagon) and then jumped in while her brother drove her around\nthe room. In this way the room was cleaned up – without lectures,\narguments or threats.\nMary Catherine Wolf of Mishawaka, Indiana, was having some\nproblems at work and decided that she had to discuss them with the boss.\nOn Monday morning she requested an appointment with him but was told\nhe was very busy and she should arrange with his secretary for an\nappointment later in the week. The secretary indicated that his schedule was\nvery tight, but she would try to fit her in.","Ms. Wolf described what happened:\n‘I did not get a reply from her all week long. Whenever I questioned\nher, she would give me a reason why the boss could not see me. Friday\nmorning came and I had heard nothing definite. I really wanted to see him\nand discuss my problems before the weekend, so I asked myself how I\ncould get him to see me.\n‘What I finally did was this. I wrote him a formal letter. I indicated in\nthe letter that I fully understood how extremely busy he was all week, but it\nwas important that I speak with him. I enclosed a form letter and a self-\naddressed envelope and asked him to please fill it out or ask his secretary to\ndo it and return it to me. The form letter read as follows:\nMs. Wolf – I will be able to see you on – at – A.M./P.M. I will\ngive you – minutes of my time.\n‘I put this letter in his in-basket at 11 A.M. At 2 P.M. I checked my\nmailbox. There was my self-addressed envelope. He had answered my form\nletter himself and indicated he could see me that afternoon and could give\nme ten minutes of his time. I met with him, and we talked for over an hour\nand resolved my problems.\n‘If I had not dramatised to him the fact that I really wanted to see him,\nI would probably be still waiting for an appointment.’\nJames B. Boynton had to present a lengthy market report. His firm had\njust finished an exhaustive study for a leading brand of cold cream. Data\nwere needed immediately about the competition in this market; the\nprospective customer was one of the biggest – and most formidable – men\nin the advertising business.\nAnd his first approach failed almost before he began.\n‘The first time I went in,’ Mr. Boynton explains, ‘I found myself\nsidetracked into a futile discussion of the methods used in the investigation.\nHe argued and I argued. He told me I was wrong, and I tried to prove that I\nwas right.\n‘I finally won my point, to my own satisfaction – but my time was up,\nthe interview was over, and I still hadn’t produced results.\n‘The second time, I didn’t bother with tabulations of figures and data. I\nwent to see this man, I dramatised my facts.","‘As I entered his office, he was busy on the phone. While he finished\nhis conversation, I opened a suitcase and dumped thirty-two jars of cold\ncream on top of his desk – all products he knew – all competitors of his\ncream.\n‘On each jar, I had a tag itemising the results of the trade investigation.\nAnd each tag told its story briefly, dramatically.\n‘What happened?\n‘There was no longer an argument. Here was something new,\nsomething different. He picked up first one then another of the jars of cold\ncream and read the information on the tag. A friendly conversation\ndeveloped. He asked additional questions. He was intensely interested. He\nhad originally given me only ten minutes to present my facts, but ten\nminutes passed, twenty minutes, forty minutes, and at the end of an hour we\nwere still talking.\n‘I was presenting the same facts this time that I had presented\npreviously. But this time I was using dramatisation, showmanship – and\nwhat a difference it made.’\nPRINCIPLE 11\nDramatise your ideas.","CHARLES SCHWAB HAD a mill manager whose people weren’t producing\ntheir quota of work.\n‘How is it,’ Schwab asked him, ‘that a manager as capable as you can’t\nmake this mill turn out what it should?’\n‘I don’t know,’ the manager replied. ‘I’ve coaxed the men, I’ve pushed\nthem, I’ve sworn and cussed, I’ve threatened them with damnation and\nbeing fired. But nothing works. They just won’t produce.’\nThis conversation took place at the end of the day, just before the night\nshift came on. Schwab asked the manager for a piece of chalk, then, turning\nto the nearest man, asked:\n‘How many heats did your shift make today?’\n‘Six.’\nWithout another word, Schwab chalked a big figure ‘6’ on the floor,\nand walked away.\nWhen the night shift came in, they saw the ‘6’ and asked what it\nmeant.\n‘The big boss was in here today,’ the day people said. ‘He asked us\nhow many heats we made, and we told him six. He chalked it on the floor.’\nThe next morning Schwab walked through the mill again. The night\nshift had rubbed out ‘6’ and replaced it with a big ‘7.’\nWhen the day shift reported for work the next morning, they saw a big\n‘7’ chalked on the floor. So the night shift thought they were better than the\nday shift, did they? Well, they would show the night shift a thing or two.\nThe crew pitched in with enthusiasm, and when they quit that night, they\nleft behind them an enormous, swaggering ‘10.’ Things were stepping up.\nShortly this mill, which had been lagging way behind in production,\nwas turning out more work than any other mill in the plant.\nThe principle?","Let Charles Schwab say it in his own words: ‘The way to get things\ndone,’ says Schwab, ‘is to stimulate competition. I do not mean in a sordid\nmoney-getting way, but in the desire to excel.’\nThe desire to excel! The challenge! Throwing down the gauntlet! An\ninfallible way of appealing to people of spirit.\nWithout a challenge, Theodore Roosevelt would never have been\nPresident of the United States. The Rough Rider, just back from Cuba, was\npicked for governor of New York State. The opposition discovered he was\nno longer a legal resident of the state, and Roosevelt, frightened, wished to\nwithdraw. Then Thomas Collier Platt, then U.S. Senator from New York,\nthrew down the challenge. Turning suddenly on Theodore Roosevelt, he\ncried in a ringing voice: ‘Is the hero of San Juan Hill a coward?’\nRoosevelt stayed in the fight – and the rest is history. A challenge not\nonly changed his life; it had a real effect upon the future of his nation.\n‘All men have fears, but the brave put down their fears and go forward,\nsometimes to death, but always to victory’ was the motto of the King’s\nGuard in ancient Greece. What greater challenge can be offered than the\nopportunity to overcome those fears?\nWhen Al Smith was the governor of New York, he was up against it.\nSing Sing, at the time the most notorious penitentiary west of Devil’s\nIsland, was without a warden. Scandals had been sweeping through the\nprison walls, scandals and ugly rumours. Smith needed a strong man to rule\nSing Sing – an iron man. But who? He sent for Lewis E. Lawes of New\nHampton.\n‘How about going up to take charge of Sing Sing?’ he said jovially\nwhen Lawes stood before him. ‘They need a man up there with experience.’\nLawes was flabbergasted. He knew the dangers of Sing Sing. It was a\npolitical appointment, subject to the vagaries of political whims. Wardens\nhad come and gone – one lasted only three weeks. He had a career to\nconsider. Was it worth the risk?\nThen Smith, who saw his hesitation, leaned back in his chair and\nsmiled. ‘Young fellow,’ he said, ‘I don’t blame you for being scared. It’s a\ntough spot. It’ll take a big person to go up there and stay.’\nSo he went. And he stayed. He stayed, to become the most famous\nwarden of his time. His book 20,000 Years in Sing Sing sold into the\nhundred of thousands of copies. His broadcasts on the air and his stories of","prison life have inspired dozens of movies. His ‘humanising’ of criminals\nwrought miracles in the way of prison reform.\n‘I have never found,’ said Harvey S. Firestone, founder of the great\nFirestone Tyre and Rubber Company, ‘that pay and pay alone would either\nbring together or hold good people. I think it was the game itself.’\nFrederic Herzberg, one of the great behavioural scientists, concurred.\nHe studied in depth the work attitudes of thousands of people ranging from\nfactory workers to senior executives. What do you think he found to be the\nmost motivating factor – the one facet of the jobs that was most\nstimulating? Money? Good working conditions? Fringe benefits? No – not\nany of those. The one major factor that motivated people was the work\nitself. If the work was exciting and interesting, the worker looked forward\nto doing it and was motivated to do a good job.\nThat is what every successful person loves: the game. The chance for\nself-expression. The chance to prove his or her worth, to excel, to win. That\nis what makes foot-races, and hog-calling, and pie-eating contests. The\ndesire to excel.

Drifting into the President’s private\noffice, he heard Coolidge say to one of his secretaries, ‘That’s a very pretty\ndress you are wearing this morning, and you are a very attractive young\nwoman.’\nThat was probably the most effusive praise Silent Cal had ever\nbestowed upon a secretary in his life. It was so unusual, so unexpected, that\nthe secretary blushed in confusion. Then Coolidge said, ‘Now, don’t get\nstuck up. I just said that to make you feel good. From now on, I wish you\nwould be a little more careful with your punctuation.’\nHis method was probably a bit obvious, but the psychology was\nsuperb. It is always easier to listen to unpleasant things after we have heard\nsome praise of our good points.\nA barber lathers a man before he shaves him; and that is precisely what\nMcKinley did back in 1896, when he was running for President. One of the\nprominent Republicans of that day had written a campaign speech that he\nfelt was just a trifle better than Cicero and Patrick Henry and Daniel\nWebster all rolled into one. With great glee, this chap read his immortal\nspeech aloud to McKinley. The speech had its fine points, but it just\nwouldn’t do. McKinley didn’t want to hurt the man’s feelings. He must not\nkill the man’s splendid enthusiasm, and yet he had to say ‘no.’ Note how\nadroitly he did it.\n‘My friend, that is a splendid speech, a magnificent speech,’ McKinley\nsaid. ‘No one could have prepared a better one. There are many occasions\non which it would be precisely the right thing to say, but is it quite suitable\nto this particular occasion? Sound and sober as it is from your standpoint, I\nmust consider its effect from the party’s standpoint. Now go home and write\na speech along the lines I indicate, and send me a copy of it.’","He did just that. McKinley blue-penciled and helped him rewrite his\nsecond speech, and he became one of the effective speakers of the\ncampaign.\nHere is the second most famous letter that Abraham Lincoln ever\nwrote. (His most famous one was written to Mrs. Bixby, expressing his\nsorrow for the death of the five sons she had lost in battle.) Lincoln\nprobably dashed this letter off in five minutes; yet it sold at public auction\nin 1926 for twelve thousand dollars, and that, by the way, was more money\nthan Lincoln was able to save during half a century of hard work. The letter\nwas written to General Joseph Hooker on April 26, 1863, during the darkest\nperiod of the Civil War. For eighteen months, Lincoln’s generals had been\nleading the Union Army from one tragic defeat to another. Nothing but\nfutile, stupid human butchery. The nation was appalled. Thousands of\nsoldiers had deserted from the army, and even the Republican members of\nthe Senate had revolted and wanted to force Lincoln out of the White\nHouse. ‘We are now on the brink of destruction,’ Lincoln said. ‘It appears\nto me that even the Almighty is against us. I can hardly see a ray of hope.’\nSuch was the period of black sorrow and chaos out of which this letter\ncame.\nI am printing the letter here because it shows how Lincoln tried to\nchange an obstreperous general when the very fate of the nation could have\ndepended upon the general’s action.\nThis is perhaps the sharpest letter Abe Lincoln wrote after he became\nPresident; yet you will note that he praised General Hooker before he spoke\nof his grave faults.\nYes, they were grave faults, but Lincoln didn’t call them that. Lincoln\nwas more conservative, more diplomatic. Lincoln wrote: ‘There are some\nthings in regard to which I am not quite satisfied with you.’ Talk about tact!\nAnd diplomacy!\nHere is the letter addressed to General Hooker:\nI have placed you at the head of the Army of the Potomac. Of\ncourse, I have done this upon what appears to me to be\nsufficient reasons, and yet I think it best for you to know that\nthere are some things in regard to which I am not quite\nsatisfied with you.","I believe you to be a brave and skillful soldier, which, of\ncourse, I like. I also believe you do not mix politics with your\nprofession, in which you are right. You have confidence in\nyourself, which is a valuable if not an indispensable quality.\nYou are ambitious, which, within reasonable bounds,\ndoes good rather than harm. But I think that during General\nBurnside’s command of the army you have taken counsel of\nyour ambition and thwarted him as much as you could, in\nwhich you did a great wrong to the country and to a most\nmeritorious and honourable brother officer.\nI have heard, in such a way as to believe it, of your\nrecently saying that both the army and the Government\nneeded a dictator. Of course, it was not for this, but in spite of\nit, that I have given you command.\nOnly those generals who gain successes can set up as\ndictators. What I now ask of you is military success and I will\nrisk the dictatorship.\nThe Government will support you to the utmost of its\nability, which is neither more nor less than it has done and\nwill do for all commanders. I much fear that the spirit which\nyou have aided to infuse into the army, of criticizing their\ncommander and withholding confidence from him, will now\nturn upon you. I shall assist you, as far as I can, to put it\ndown.\nNeither you nor Napoleon, if he were alive again, could\nget any good out of an army while such spirit prevails in it,\nand now beware of rashness. Beware of rashness, but with\nenergy and sleepless vigilance, go forward and give us\nvictories.\nYou are not a Coolidge, a McKinley or a Lincoln. You want to know\nwhether this philosophy will operate for you in everyday business contacts.\nWill it? Let’s see. Let’s take the case of W.P. Gaw, of the Wark Company,\nPhiladelphia.\nThe Wark Company had contracted to build and complete a large\noffice building in Philadelphia by a certain specified date. Everything was\ngoing along well; the building was almost finished, when suddenly the","subcontractor making the ornamental bronze work to go on the exterior of\nthis building declared that he couldn’t make delivery on schedule. What!\nAn entire building held up! Heavy penalties! Distressing losses! All\nbecause of one man!\nLong-distance telephone calls. Arguments! Heated conversations! All\nin vain. Then Mr. Gaw was sent to New York to beard the bronze lion in his\nden.\n‘Do you know you are the only person in Brooklyn with your name?’\nMr. Gaw asked the president of the subcontracting firm shortly after they\nwere introduced. The president was surprised. ‘No, I didn’t know that.’\n‘Well,’ said Mr. Gaw, ‘when I got off the train this morning, I looked\nin the telephone book to get your address, and you’re the only person in the\nBrooklyn phone book with your name.’\n‘I never knew that,’ the subcontractor said. He checked the phone book\nwith interest. ‘Well, it’s an unusual name,’ he said proudly. ‘My family\ncame from Holland and settled in New York almost two hundred years ago.’\nHe continued to talk about his family and his ancestors for several minutes.\nWhen he finished that, Mr. Gaw complimented him on how large a plant he\nhad and compared it favourably with a number of similar plants he had\nvisited. ‘It is one of the cleanest and neatest bronze factories I ever saw.’\nsaid Gaw.\n‘I’ve spent a lifetime building up this business,’ the subcontractor said,\n‘and I am rather proud of it. Would you like to take a look around the\nfactory?’\nDuring this tour of inspection, Mr. Gaw complimented the other man\non his system of fabrication and told him how and why it seemed superior\nto those of some of his competitors. Gaw commented on some unusual\nmachines, and the subcontractor announced that he himself had invented\nthose machines. He spent considerable time showing Gaw how they\noperated and the superior work they turned out. He insisted on taking his\nvisitor to lunch. So far, mind you, not a word had been said about the real\npurpose of Gaw’s visit.\nAfter lunch, the subcontractor said, ‘Now, to get down to business.\nNaturally, I know why you’re here. I didn’t expect that our meeting would\nbe so enjoyable. You can go back to Philadelphia with my promise that your\nmaterial will be fabricated and shipped, even if other orders have to be\ndelayed.’","Mr. Gaw got everything that he wanted without even asking for it. The\nmaterial arrived on time, and the building was completed on the day the\ncompletion contract specified.\nWould this have happened had Mr. Gaw used the hammer-and-\ndynamite method generally employed on such occasions?\nDorothy Wrublewski, a branch manager of the Fort Monmouth, New\nJersey, Federal Credit Union, reported to one of our classes how she was\nable to help one of her employees become more productive.\n‘We recently hired a young lady as a teller trainee. Her contact with\nour customers was very good. She was accurate and efficient in handling\nindividual transactions. The problem developed at the end of the day when\nit was time to balance out.\n‘The head teller came to me and strongly suggested that I fire this\nwoman. “She is holding up everyone else because she is so slow in\nbalancing out. I’ve shown her over and over, but she can’t get it. She’s got\nto go.”\n‘The next day I observed her working quickly and accurately when\nhandling the normal everyday transactions, and she was very pleasant with\nour customers.\n‘It didn’t take long to discover why she had trouble balancing out.\nAfter the office closed, I went over to talk with her. She was obviously\nnervous and upset. I praised her for being so friendly and outgoing with the\ncustomers and complimented her for the accuracy and speed used in that\nwork. I then suggested we review the procedure we use in balancing the\ncash drawer. Once she realised I had confidence in her, she easily followed\nmy suggestions and soon mastered this function. We have had no problems\nwith her since then.’\nBeginning with praise is like the dentist who begins his work with\nNovocain. The patient still gets a drilling, but the Novocain is pain-killing.\nA leader will use . . .\nPRINCIPLE 1\nBegin with praise and honest appreciation.","CHARLES SCHWAB WAS passing through one of his steel mills one day at\nnoon when he came across some of his employees smoking. Immediately\nabove their heads was a sign that said ‘No Smoking.’ Did Schwab point to\nthe sign and say, ‘Can’t you read?’ Oh no, not Schwab. He walked over to\nthe men, handed each one a cigar, and said, ‘I’ll appreciate it, boys, if you\nwill smoke these on the outside.’ They knew that he knew that they had\nbroken a rule – and they admired him because he said nothing about it and\ngave them a little present and made them feel important. Couldn’t keep\nfrom loving a man like that, could you?\nJohn Wanamaker used the same technique. Wanamaker used to make a\ntour of his great store in Philadelphia every day. Once he saw a customer\nwaiting at a counter. No one was paying the slightest attention to her. The\nsalespeople? Oh, they were in a huddle at the far end of the counter\nlaughing and talking among themselves. Wanamaker didn’t say a word.\nQuietly slipping behind the counter, he waited on the woman himself and\nthen handed the purchase to the salespeople to be wrapped as he went on\nhis way.\nPublic officials are often criticised for not being accessible to their\nconstituents. They are busy people, and the fault sometimes lies in\noverprotective assistants who don’t want to overburden their bosses with\ntoo many visitors. Carl Langford, who has been mayor of Orlando, Florida,\nthe home of Disney World, for many years, frequently admonished his staff\nto allow people to see him. He claimed he had an ‘open-door’ policy; yet\nthe citizens of his community were blocked by secretaries and\nadministrators when they called.\nFinally the mayor found the solution. He removed the door from his\noffice! His aides got the message, and the mayor has had a truly open\nadministration since the day his door was symbolically thrown away.","Simply changing one three-letter word can often spell the difference\nbetween failure and success in changing people without giving offence or\narousing resentment.\nMany people begin their criticism with sincere praise followed by the\nword ‘but’ and ending with a critical statement. For example, in trying to\nchange a child’s careless attitude toward studies, we might say, ‘We’re\nreally proud of you, Johnnie, for raising your grades this term. But if you\nhad worked harder on your algebra, the results would have been better.’\nIn this case, Johnnie might feel encouraged until he heard the word\n‘but.’ He might then question the sincerity of the original praise. To him,\nthe praise seemed only to be a contrived lead-in to a critical inference of\nfailure. Credibility would be strained, and we probably would not achieve\nour objectives of changing Johnnie’s attitude toward his studies.\nThis could be easily overcome by changing the word ‘but’ to ‘and.’\n‘We’re really proud of you, Johnnie, for raising your grades this term, and\nby continuing the same conscientious efforts next term, your algebra grade\ncan be up with all the others.’\nNow, Johnnie would accept the praise because there was no follow-up\nof an inference of failure. We have called his attention to the behaviour we\nwished to change indirectly, and the chances are he will try to live up to our\nexpectations.\nCalling attention to one’s mistakes indirectly works wonders with\nsensitive people who may resent bitterly any direct criticism. Marge Jacob\nof Woonsocket, Rhode Island, told one of our classes how she convinced\nsome sloppy construction workers to clean up after themselves when they\nwere building additions to her house.\nFor the first few days of the work, when Mrs. Jacob returned from her\njob, she noticed that the yard was strewn with the cut ends of lumber. She\ndidn’t want to antagonise the builders, because they did excellent work. So\nafter the workers had gone home, she and her children picked up and neatly\npiled all the lumber debris in a corner. The following morning she called the\nforeman to one side and said, ‘I’m really pleased with the way the front\nlawn was left last night; it is nice and clean and does not offend the\nneighbours.’ From that day forward the workers picked up and piled the\ndebris to one side, and the foreman came in each day seeking approval of\nthe condition the lawn was left in after a day’s work.","One of the major areas of controversy between members of the army\nreserves and their regular army trainers is haircuts. The reservists consider\nthemselves civilians (which they are most of the time) and resent having to\ncut their hair short.\nMaster Sergeant Harley Kaiser of the 542nd USAR School addressed\nhimself to this problem when he was working with a group of reserve\nnoncommissioned officers. As an old-time regular-army master sergeant, he\nmight have been expected to yell at his troops and threaten them. Instead he\nchose to make his point indirectly.\n‘Gentlemen,’ he started, ‘you are leaders. You will be most effective\nwhen you lead by example. You must be the example for your men to\nfollow. You know what the army regulations say about haircuts. I am going\nto get my hair cut today, although it is still much shorter than some of\nyours. You look at yourself in the mirror, and if you feel you need a haircut\nto be a good example, we’ll arrange time for you to visit the post\nbarbership.’\nThe result was predictable. Several of the candidates did look in the\nmirror and went to the barbershop that afternoon and received ‘regulation’\nhaircuts. Sergeant Kaiser commented the next morning that he already\ncould see the development of leadership qualities in some of the members\nof the squad.\nOn March 8, 1887, the eloquent Henry Ward Beecher died. The\nfollowing Sunday, Lyman Abbott was invited to speak in the pulpit left\nsilent by Beecher’s passing. Eager to do his best, he wrote, rewrote and\npolished his sermon with the meticulous care of a Flaubert. Then he read it\nto his wife. It was poor – as most written speeches are. She might have said,\nif she had had less judgement, ‘Lyman, that is terrible. That’ll never do.\nYou’ll put people to sleep. It reads like an encyclopedia. You ought to know\nbetter than that after all the years you have been preaching. For heaven’s\nsake, why don’t you talk like a human being? Why don’t you act natural?\nYou’ll disgrace yourself if you ever read that stuff.’\nThat’s what she might have said. And, if she had, you know what\nwould have happened. And she knew too. So, she merely remarked that it\nwould make an excellent article for the North American Review. In other\nwords, she praised it and at the same time subtly suggested that it wouldn’t\ndo as a speech. Lyman Abbott saw the point, tore up his carefully prepared\nmanuscript and preached without even using notes.","An effective way to correct others’ mistakes is . . .\nPRINCIPLE 2\nCall attention to people’s mistakes indirectly.","MY NIECE, JOSEPHINE Carnegie, had come to New York to be my secretary.\nShe was nineteen, had graduated from high school three years previously,\nand her business experience was a trifle more than zero. She became one of\nthe most proficient secretaries west of Suez, but in the beginning, she was –\nwell, susceptible to improvement. One day when I started to criticise her, I\nsaid to myself: ‘Just a minute, Dale Carnegie; just a minute. You are twice\nas old as Josephine. You have had ten thousand times as much business\nexperience. How can you possibly expect her to have your viewpoint, your\njudgement, your initiative – mediocre though they may be? And just a\nminute, Dale, what were you doing at nineteen? Remember the asinine\nmistakes and blunders you made? Remember the time you did this . . . and\nthat . . . ?’\nAfter thinking the matter over, honestly and impartially, I concluded\nthat Josephine’s batting average at nineteen was better than mine had been –\nand that, I’m sorry to confess, isn’t paying Josephine much of a\ncompliment.\nSo after that, when I wanted to call Josephine’s attention to a mistake, I\nused to begin by saying, ‘You have made a mistake, Josephine, but the Lord\nknows, it’s no worse than many I have made. You were not born with\njudgement. That comes only with experience, and you are better than I was\nat your age. I have been guilty of so many stupid, silly things myself, I have\nvery little inclination to criticise you or anyone. But don’t you think it\nwould have been wiser if you had done so and so?’\nIt isn’t nearly so difficult to listen to a recital of your faults if the\nperson criticising begins by humbly admitting that he, too, is far from\nimpeccable.\nE.G. Dillistone, an engineer in Brandon, Manitoba, Canada, was\nhaving problems with his new secretary. Letters he dictated were coming to","his desk for signature with two or three spelling mistakes per page. Mr.\nDillistone reported how he handled this:\n‘Like many engineers, I have not been noted for my excellent English\nor spelling. For years I have kept a little black thumb-index book for words\nI had trouble spelling. When it became apparent that merely pointing out\nthe errors was not going to cause my secretary to do more proofreading and\ndictionary work, I resolved to take another approach. When the next letter\ncame to my attention that had errors in it, I sat down with the typist and\nsaid:\n‘“Somehow this word doesn’t look right. It’s one of the words I always\nhave had trouble with. That’s the reason I started this spelling book of mine.\n[I opened the book to the appropriate page.] Yes, here it is. I’m very\nconscious of my spelling now because people do judge us by our letters and\nmisspellings make us look less professional.”\n‘I don’t know whether she copied my system or not, but since that\nconversation, her frequency of spelling errors has been significantly\nreduced.’\nThe polished Prince Bernhard von Bülow learned the sharp necessity\nof doing this back in 1909. Von Bülow was then the Imperial Chancellor of\nGermany, and on the throne sat Wilhelm II – Wilhelm, the haughty;\nWilhelm, the arrogant; Wilhelm, the last of the German Kaisers, building an\narmy and navy that he boasted could whip their weight in wildcats.\nThen an astonishing thing happened. The Kaiser said things, incredible\nthings, things that rocked the continent and started a series of explosions\nheard around the world. To make matters infinitely worse, the Kaiser made\nsilly, egotistical, absurd announcements in public, he made them while he\nwas a guest in England, and he gave his royal permission to have them\nprinted in the Daily Telegraph. For example, he declared that he was the\nonly German who felt friendly toward the English; that he was constructing\na navy against the menace of Japan; that he, and he alone, had saved\nEngland from being humbled in the dust by Russia and France; that it had\nbeen his campaign plan that enabled England’s Lord Roberts to defeat the\nBoers in South Africa; and so on and on.\nNo other such amazing words had ever fallen from the lips of a\nEuropean king in peacetime within a hundred years. The entire continent\nbuzzed with the fury of a hornet’s nest. England was incensed. German\nstatesmen were aghast. And in the midst of all this consternation, the Kaiser","became panicky and suggested to Prince von Bülow, the Imperial\nChancellor, that he take the blame. Yes, he wanted von Bülow to announce\nthat it was all his responsibility, that he had advised his monarch to say\nthese incredible things.\n‘But Your Majesty,’ von Bülow protested, ‘it seems to me utterly\nimpossible that anybody either in Germany or England could suppose me\ncapable of having advised Your Majesty to say any such thing.’\nThe moment those words were out of von Bülow’s mouth, he realised\nhe had made a grave mistake. The Kaiser blew up.\n‘You consider me a donkey,’ he shouted, ‘capable of blunders you\nyourself could never have committed!’\nVon Bülow knew that he ought to have praised before he condemned;\nbut since that was too late, he did the next best thing. He praised after he\nhad criticised. And it worked a miracle.\n‘I’m far from suggesting that,’ he answered respectfully. ‘Your\nMajesty surpasses me in many respects; not only, of course, in naval and\nmilitary knowledge, but above all, in natural science. I have often listened\nin admiration when Your Majesty explained the barometer, or wireless\ntelegraphy, or the Roentgen rays. I am shamefully ignorant of all branches\nof natural science, have no notion of chemistry or physics, and am quite\nincapable of explaining the simplest of natural phenomena. But,’ von\nBülow continued, ‘in compensation, I possess some historical knowledge\nand perhaps certain qualities useful in politics, especially in diplomacy.’\nThe Kaiser beamed. Von Bülow had praised him. Von Bülow had\nexalted him and humbled himself. The Kaiser could forgive anything after\nthat. ‘Haven’t I always told you,’ he exclaimed with enthusiasm, ‘that we\ncomplete one another famously? We should stick together, and we will!’\nHe shook hands with von Bülow, not once, but several times. And later\nin the day he waxed so enthusiastic that he exclaimed with doubled fists, ‘If\nanyone says anything to me against Prince von Bülow, I shall punch him in\nthe nose.’\nVon Bülow saved himself in time – but, canny diplomat that he was, he\nnevertheless had made one error: he should have begun by talking about his\nown shortcomings and Wilhelm’s superiority – not by intimating that the\nKaiser was a half-wit in need of a guardian.\nIf a few sentences humbling oneself and praising the other party can\nturn a haughty, insulted Kaiser into a staunch friend, imagine what humility","and praise can do for you and me in our daily contacts. Rightfully used,\nthey will work veritable miracles in human relations.\nAdmitting one’s own mistakes – even when one hasn’t corrected them\n– can help convince somebody to change his behaviour. This was illustrated\nmore recently by Clarence Zerhusen of Timonium, Maryland, when he\ndiscovered his fifteen-year-old son was experimenting with cigarettes.\n‘Naturally, I didn’t want David to smoke,’ Mr. Zerhusen told us, ‘but\nhis mother and I smoked cigarettes; we were giving him a bad example all\nthe time. I explained to Dave how I started smoking at about his age and\nhow the nicotine had gotten the best of me and now it was nearly\nimpossible for me to stop. I reminded him how irritating my cough was and\nhow he had been after me to give up cigarettes not many years before.\n‘I didn’t exhort him to stop or make threats or warn him about their\ndangers. All I did was point out how I was hooked on cigarettes and what it\nhad meant to me.\n‘He thought about it for a while and decided he wouldn’t smoke until\nhe had graduated from high school. As the years went by David never did\nstart smoking and has no intention of ever doing so.\n‘As a result of that conversation I made the decision to stop smoking\ncigarettes myself, and with the support of my family, I have succeeded.’\nA good leader follows this principle:\nPRINCIPLE 3\nTalk about your own mistakes before criticising the other person.","I ONCE HAD the pleasure of dining with Miss Ida Tarbell, the dean of\nAmerican biographers. When I told her I was writing this book, we began\ndiscussing this all-important subject of getting along with people, and she\ntold me that while she was writing her biography of Owen D. Young, she\ninterviewed a man who had sat for three years in the same office with Mr.\nYoung. This man declared that during all that time he had never heard\nOwen D. Young give a direct order to anyone. He always gave suggestions,\nnot orders. Owen D. Young never said, for example, ‘Do this or do that,’ or\n‘Don’t do this or don’t do that.’ He would say, ‘You might consider this,’ or\n‘Do you think that would work?’ Frequently he would say, after he had\ndictated a letter, ‘What do you think of this?’ In looking over a letter of one\nof his assistants, he would say, ‘Maybe if we were to phrase it this way it\nwould be better.’ He always gave people the opportunity to do things\nthemselves; he never told his assistants to do things; he let them do them,\nlet them learn from their mistakes.\nA technique like that makes it easy for a person to correct errors. A\ntechnique like that saves a person’s pride and gives him or her a feeling of\nimportance. It encourages cooperation instead of rebellion.\nResentment caused by a brash order may last a long time – even if the\norder was given to correct an obviously bad situation. Dan Santarelli, a\nteacher at a vocational school in Wyoming, Pennsylvania, told one of our\nclasses how one of his students had blocked the entrance way to one of the\nschool’s shops by illegally parking his car in it. One of the other instructors\nstormed into the classroom and asked in an arrogant tone, ‘Whose car is\nblocking the driveway?’ When the student who owned the car responded,\nthe instructor screamed: ‘Move that car and move it right now, or I’ll wrap a\nchain around it and drag it out of there.’\nNow that student was wrong. The car should not have been parked\nthere. But from that day on, not only did that student resent the instructor’s","action, but all the students in the class did everything they could to give the\ninstructor a hard time and make his job unpleasant.\nHow could he have handled it differently? If he had asked in a friendly\nway, ‘Whose car is in the driveway?’ and then suggested that if it were\nmoved, other cars could get in and out, the student would have gladly\nmoved it and neither he nor his classmates would have been upset and\nresentful.\nAsking questions not only makes an order more palatable; it often\nstimulates the creativity of the persons whom you ask. People are more\nlikely to accept an order if they have had a part in the decision that caused\nthe order to be issued.\nWhen Ian Macdonald of Johannesburg, South Africa, the general\nmanager of a small manufacturing plant specialising in precision machine\nparts, had the opportunity to accept a very large order, he was convinced\nthat he would not meet the promised delivery date. The work already\nscheduled in the shop and the short completion time needed for this order\nmade it seem impossible for him to accept the order.\nInstead of pushing his people to accelerate their work and rush the\norder through, he called everybody together, explained the situation to\nthem, and told them how much it would mean to the company and to them\nif they could make it possible to produce the order on time. Then he started\nasking questions:\n‘Is there anything we can do to handle this order?’\n‘Can anyone think of different ways to process it through the shop that\nwill make it possible to take the order?’\n‘Is there any way to adjust our hours or personnel assignments that\nwould help?’\nThe employees came up with many ideas and insisted that he take the\norder. They approached it with a ‘We can do it’ attitude, and the order was\naccepted, produced and delivered on time.\nAn effective leader will use . . .\nPRINCIPLE 4","Ask questions instead of giving direct orders.","YEARS AGO THE General Electric Company was faced with the delicate task\nof removing Charles Steinmetz from the head of a department. Steinmetz, a\ngenius of the first magnitude when it came to electricity, was a failure as the\nhead of the calculating department. Yet the company didn’t dare offend the\nman. He was indispensable – and highly sensitive. So they gave him a new\ntitle. They made him Consulting Engineer of the General Electric Company\n– a new title for work he was already doing – and let someone else head up\nthe department.\nSteinmetz was happy.\nSo were the officers of G.E. They had gently manoeuvred their most\ntemperamental star, and they had done it without a storm – by letting him\nsave face.\nLetting one save face! How important, how vitally important that is!\nAnd how few of us ever stop to think of it! We ride roughshod over the\nfeelings of others, getting our own way, finding fault, issuing threats,\ncriticising a child or an employee in front of others, without even\nconsidering the hurt to the other person’s pride. Whereas a few minutes’\nthought, a considerate word or two, a genuine understanding of the other\nperson’s attitude, would go so far toward alleviating the sting!\nLet’s remember that the next time we are faced with the distasteful\nnecessity of discharging or reprimanding an employee.\n‘Firing employees is not much fun. Getting fired is even less fun.’ (I’m\nquoting now from a letter written me by Marshall A. Granger, a certified\npublic accountant.) ‘Our business is mostly seasonal. Therefore we have to\nlet a lot of people go after the income tax rush is over.\n‘It’s a byword in our profession that no one enjoys wielding the axe.\nConsequently, the custom has developed of getting it over as soon as\npossible, and usually in the following way: “Sit down, Mr. Smith. The\nseason’s over, and we don’t seem to see any more assignments for you. Of","course, you understood you were only employed for the busy season\nanyhow, etc., etc.”\n‘The effect on these people is one of disappointment and a feeling of\nbeing “let down.” Most of them are in the accounting field for life, and they\nretain no particular love for the firm that drops them so casually.\n‘I recently decided to let our seasonal personnel go with a little more\ntact and consideration. So I call each one in only after carefully thinking\nover his or her work during the winter. And I’ve said something like this:\n“Mr. Smith, you’ve done a fine job (if he has). That time we sent you to\nNewark, you had a tough assignment. You were on the spot, but you came\nthrough with flying colours, and we want you to know the firm is proud of\nyou. You’ve got the stuff – you’re going a long way, wherever you’re\nworking. This firm believes in you, and is rooting for you, and we don’t\nwant you to forget it.”\n‘Effect? The people go away feeling a lot better about being fired.\nThey don’t feel “let down.” They know if we had work for them, we’d keep\nthem on. And when we need them again, they come to us with a keen\npersonal affection.’\nAt one session of our course, two class members discussed the\nnegative effects of faultfinding versus the positive effects of letting the\nother person save face.\nFred Clark of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, told of an incident that\noccurred in his company: ‘At one of our production meetings, a vice\npresident was asking very pointed questions of one of our production\nsupervisors regarding a production process. His tone of voice was\naggressive and aimed at pointing out faulty performance on the part of the\nsupervisor. Not wanting to be embarrassed in front of his peers, the\nsupervisor was evasive in his responses. This caused the vice president to\nlose his temper, berate the supervisor and accuse him of lying.\n‘Any working relationship that might have existed prior to this\nencounter was destroyed in a few brief moments. This supervisor, who was\nbasically a good worker, was useless to our company from that time on. A\nfew months later he left our firm and went to work for a competitor, where I\nunderstand he is doing a fine job.’\nAnother class member, Anna Mazzone, related how a similar incident\nhad occurred at her job – but what a difference in approach and results! Ms.\nMazzone, a marketing specialist for a food packer, was given her first major","assignment – the testmarketing of a new product. She told the class: ‘When\nthe results of the test came in, I was devastated. I had made a serious error\nin my planning, and the entire test had to be done all over again. To make\nthis worse, I had no time to discuss it with my boss before the meeting in\nwhich I was to make my report on the project.\n‘When I was called on to give the report, I was shaking with fright. I\nhad all I could do to keep from breaking down, but I resolved I would not\ncry and have all those men make remarks about women not being able to\nhandle a management job because they are too emotional. I made my report\nbriefly and stated that due to an error I would repeat the study before the\nnext meeting. I sat down, expecting my boss to blow up.\n‘Instead, he thanked me for my work and remarked that it was not\nunusual for a person to make an error on a new project and that he had\nconfidence that the repeat survey would be accurate and meaningful to the\ncompany. He assured me, in front of all my colleagues, that he had faith in\nme and knew I had done my best, and that my lack of experience, not my\nlack of ability, was the reason for the failure.\n‘I left that meeting with my head up in the air and with the\ndetermination that I would never let that boss of mine down again.’\nEven if we are right and the other person is definitely wrong, we only\ndestroy ego by causing someone to lose face. The legendary French\naviation pioneer and author Antoine de Saint-Exupéry wrote: ‘I have no\nright to say or do anything that diminishes a man in his own eyes. What\nmatters is not what I think of him, but what he thinks of himself. Hurting a\nman in his dignity is a crime.’\nA real leader will always follow . . .\nPRINCIPLE 5\nLet the other person save face.","PETE BARLOW WAS an old friend of mine. He had a dog-and-pony act and\nspent his life travelling with circuses and vaudeville shows. I loved to watch\nPete train new dogs for his act. I noticed that the moment a dog showed the\nslightest improvement, Pete patted and praised him and gave him meat and\nmade a great to-do about it.\nThat’s nothing new. Animal trainers have been using that same\ntechnique for centuries.\nWhy, I wonder, don’t we use the same common sense when trying to\nchange people that we use when trying to change dogs? Why don’t we use\nmeat instead of a whip? Why don’t we use praise instead of condemnation?\nLet us praise even the slightest improvement. That inspires the other person\nto keep on improving.\nIn his book I Ain’t Much, Baby – But I’m All I Got, the psychologist\nJess Lair comments: ‘Praise is like sunlight to the warm human spirit; we\ncannot flower and grow without it. And yet, while most of us are only too\nready to apply to others the cold wind of criticism, we are somehow\nreluctant to give our fellow the warm sunshine of praise.’\n1\nI can look back at my own life and see where a few words of praise\nhave sharply changed my entire future. Can’t you say the same thing about\nyour life? History is replete with striking illustrations of the sheer witchery\nof praise.\nFor example, many years ago a boy of ten was working in a factory in\nNaples. He longed to be a singer, but his first teacher discouraged him. ‘You\ncan’t sing,’ he said. ‘You haven’t any voice at all. It sounds like the wind in\nthe shutters.’\nBut his mother, a poor peasant woman, put her arms about him and\npraised him and told him she knew he could sing, she could already see an\nimprovement, and she went barefoot in order to save money to pay for his\nmusic lessons. That peasant mother’s praise and encouragement changed","that boy’s life. His name was Enrico Caruso, and he became the greatest\nand most famous opera singer of his age.\nIn the early nineteenth century, a young man in London aspired to be a\nwriter. But everything seemed to be against him. He had never been able to\nattend school more than four years. His father had been flung in jail because\nhe couldn’t pay his debts, and this young man often knew the pangs of\nhunger. Finally, he got a job pasting labels on bottles of blacking in a rat-\ninfested warehouse, and he slept at night in a dismal attic room with two\nother boys – guttersnipes from the slums of London. He had so little\nconfidence in his ability to write that he sneaked out and mailed his first\nmanuscript in the dead of night so nobody would laugh at him. Story after\nstory was refused. Finally the great day came when one was accepted. True,\nhe wasn’t paid a shilling for it, but one editor had praised him. One editor\nhad given him recognition. He was so thrilled that he wandered aimlessly\naround the streets with tears rolling down his cheeks.\nThe praise, the recognition, that he received through getting one story\nin print, changed his whole life, for if it hadn’t been for that encouragement,\nhe might have spent his entire life working in rat-infested factories. You\nmay have heard of that boy. His name was Charles Dickens.\nAnother boy in London made his living as a clerk in a dry-goods store.\nHe had to get up at five o’clock, sweep out the store, and slave for fourteen\nhours a day. It was sheer drudgery and he despised it. After two years, he\ncould stand it no longer, so he got up one morning and, without waiting for\nbreakfast, tramped fifteen miles to talk to his mother, who was working as a\nhousekeeper.\nHe was frantic. He pleaded with her. He wept. He swore he would kill\nhimself if he had to remain in the shop any longer. Then he wrote a long,\npathetic letter to his old schoolmaster, declaring that he was heartbroken,\nthat he no longer wanted to live. His old schoolmaster gave him a little\npraise and assured him that he really was very intelligent and fitted for finer\nthings and offered him a job as a teacher.\nThat praise changed the future of that boy and made a lasting\nimpression on the history of English literature. For that boy went on to\nwrite innumerable best-selling books and made over a million dollars with\nhis pen. You’ve probably heard of him. His name: H.G. Wells.\nUse of praise instead of criticism is the basic concept of B.F. Skinner’s\nteachings. This great contemporary psychologist has shown by experiments","with animals and with humans that when criticism is minimised and praise\nemphasised, the good things people do will be reinforced and the poorer\nthings will atrophy for lack of attention.\nJohn Ringelspaugh of Rocky Mount, North Carolina, used this in\ndealing with his children. It seemed that, as in so many families, mother and\ndad’s chief form of communication with the children was yelling at them.\nAnd, as in so many cases, the children became a little worse rather than\nbetter after each such session – and so did the parents. There seemed to be\nno end in sight for this problem.\nMr. Ringelspaugh determined to use some of the principles he was\nlearning in our course to solve this situation. He reported: ‘We decided to\ntry praise instead of harping on their faults. It wasn’t easy when all we\ncould see were the negative things they were doing; it was really tough to\nfind things to praise. We managed to find something, and within the first\nday or two some of the really upsetting things they were doing quit\nhappening. Then some of their other faults began to disappear. They began\ncapitalising on the praise we were giving them. They even began going out\nof their way to do things right. Neither of us could believe it. Of course, it\ndidn’t last forever, but the norm reached after things levelled off was so\nmuch better. It was no longer necessary to react the way we used to. The\nchildren were doing far more right things than wrong ones.’ All of this was\na result of praising the slightest improvement in the children rather than\ncondemning everything they did wrong.\nThis works on the job too. Keith Roper of Woodland Hills, California,\napplied this principle to a situation in his company. Some material came to\nhim in his print shop which was of exceptionally high quality. The printer\nwho had done this job was a new employee who had been having difficulty\nadjusting to the job. His supervisor was upset about what he considered a\nnegative attitude and was seriously thinking of terminating his services.\nWhen Mr. Roper was informed of this situation, he personally went\nover to the print shop and had a talk with the young man. He told him how\npleased he was with the work he had just received and pointed out it was\nthe best work he had seen produced in that shop for some time. He pointed\nout exactly why it was superior and how important the young man’s\ncontribution was to the company.\nDo you think this affected that young printer’s attitude toward the\ncompany? Within days there was a complete turn-about. He told several of","his co-workers about the conversation and how someone in the company\nreally appreciated good work. And from that day on, he was a loyal and\ndedicated worker.\nWhat Mr. Roper did was not just flatter the young printer and say\n‘You’re good.’ He specifically pointed out how his work was superior.\nBecause he had singled out a specific accomplishment, rather than just\nmaking general flattering remarks, his praise became much more\nmeaningful to the person to whom it was given. Everybody likes to be\npraised, but when praise is specific, it comes across as sincere – not\nsomething the other person may be saying just to make one feel good.\nRemember, we all crave appreciation and recognition, and will do\nalmost anything to get it. But nobody wants insincerity. Nobody wants\nflattery.\nLet me repeat: The principles taught in this book will work only when\nthey come from the heart. I am not advocating a bag of tricks. I am talking\nabout a new way of life.\nTalking about changing people. If you and I will inspire the people\nwith whom we come in contact to a realisation of the hidden treasures they\npossess, we can do far more than change people. We can literally transform\nthem.\nExaggeration? Then listen to these sage words from William James,\none of the most distinguished psychologists and philosophers America has\never produced:\nCompared with what we ought to be, we are only half awake.\nWe are making use of only a small part of our physical and\nmental resources. Stating the thing broadly, the human\nindividual thus lives far within his limits. He possesses powers\nof various sorts which he habitually fails to use.\nYes, you who are reading these lines possess powers of various sorts which\nyou habitually fail to use; and one of these powers you are probably not\nusing to the fullest extent is your magic ability to praise people and inspire\nthem with a realisation of their latent possibilities.\nAbilities wither under criticism; they blossom under encouragement.\nTo become a more effective leader of people, apply . . .","PRINCIPLE 6\nPraise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement.

You can fire him or her, but that really doesn’t solve\nanything. You can berate the worker, but this usually causes resentment.\nHenry Henke, a service manager for a large truck dealership in Lowell,\nIndiana, had a mechanic whose work had become less than satisfactory.\nInstead of bawling him out or threatening him, Mr. Henke called him into\nhis office and had a heart-to-heart talk with him.\n‘Bill,’ he said, ‘you are a fine mechanic. You have been in this line of\nwork for a good number of years. You have repaired many vehicles to the\ncustomers’ satisfaction. In fact, we’ve had a number of compliments about\nthe good work you have done. Yet, of late, the time you take to complete\neach job has been increasing and your work has not been up to your own\nold standards. Because you have been such an outstanding mechanic in the\npast, I felt sure you would want to know that I am not happy with this\nsituation, and perhaps jointly we could find some way to correct the\nproblem.’\nBill responded that he hadn’t realised he had been falling down in his\nduties and assured his boss that the work he was getting was not out of his\nrange of expertise and he would try to improve in the future.\nDid he do it? You can be sure he did. He once again became a fast and\nthorough mechanic. With that reputation Mr. Henke had given him to live\nup to, how could he do anything else but turn out work comparable to that\nwhich he had done in the past.\n‘The average person,’ said Samuel Vauclain, then president of the\nBaldwin Locomotive Works, ‘can be led readily if you have his or her\nrespect and if you show that you respect that person for some kind of\nability.’\nIn short, if you want to improve a person in a certain respect, act as\nthough that particular trait were already one of his or her outstanding\ncharacteristics. Shakespeare said ‘Assume a virtue, if you have it not.’ And\nit might be well to assume and state openly that other people have the virtue","you want them to develop. Give them a fine reputation to live up to, and\nthey will make prodigious efforts rather than see you disillusioned.\nGeorgette Leblanc, in her book Souvenirs, My life with Maeterlinck,\ndescribes the startling transformation of a humble Belgian Cinderella.\n‘A servant girl from a neighbouring hotel brought my meals,’ she\nwrote. ‘She was called “Marie the Dishwasher” because she had started her\ncareer as a scullery assistant. She was a kind of monster, cross-eyed, bandy-\nlegged, poor in flesh and spirit.\n‘One day, while she was holding my plate of macaroni in her red hand,\nI said to her point-blank, “Marie, you do not know what treasures are within\nyou.”\n‘Accustomed to holding back her emotion, Marie waited for a few\nmoments, not daring to risk the slightest gesture for fear of a catastrophe.\nThen she put the dish on the table, sighed and said ingenuously, “Madame, I\nwould never have believed it.” She did not doubt, she did not ask a\nquestion. She simply went back to the kitchen and repeated what I had said,\nand such is the force of faith that no one made fun of her. From that day on,\nshe was even given a certain consideration. But the most curious change of\nall occurred in the humble Marie herself. Believing she was the tabernacle\nof unseen marvels, she began taking care of her face and body so carefully\nthat her starved youth seemed to bloom and modestly hide her plainness.\n‘Two months later, she announced her coming marriage with the\nnephew of the chef. “I’m going to be a lady,” she said, and thanked me. A\nsmall phrase had changed her entire life.’\nGeorgette Leblanc had given ‘Marie the Dishwasher’ a reputation to\nlive up to – and that reputation had transformed her.\nBill Parker, a sales representative for a food company in Daytona\nBeach, Florida, was very excited about the new line of products his\ncompany was introducing and was upset when the manager of a large\nindependent food market turned down the opportunity to carry it in his\nstore. Bill brooded all day over this rejection and decided to return to the\nstore before he went home that evening and try again.\n‘Jack,’ he said, ‘since I left this morning I realised I hadn’t given you\nthe entire picture of our new line, and I would appreciate some of your time\nto tell you about the points I omitted. I have respected the fact that you are\nalways willing to listen and are big enough to change your mind when the\nfacts warrant a change.’","Could Jack refuse to give him another hearing? Not with that\nreputation to live up to.\nOne morning Dr. Martin Fitzhugh, a dentist in Dublin, Ireland, was\nshocked when one of his patients pointed out to him that the metal cup\nholder which she was using to rinse her mouth was not very clean. True, the\npatient drank from the paper cup, not the holder, but it certainly was not\nprofessional to use tarnished equipment.\nWhen the patient left, Dr. Fitzhugh retreated to his private office to\nwrite a note to Bridgit, the charwoman, who came twice a week to clean his\noffice. He wrote:\nMy dear Bridgit,\nI see you so seldom, I thought I’d take the time to thank you\nfor the fine job of cleaning you’ve been doing. By the way, I\nthought I’d mention that since two hours, twice a week, is a\nvery limited amount of time, please feel free to work an extra\nhalf hour from time to time if you feel you need to do those\n‘once-in-a-while’ things like polishing the cup holders and the\nlike. I, of course, will pay you for the extra time.\n‘The next day, when I walked into my office,’ Dr. Fitzhugh reported, ‘my\ndesk had been polished to a mirror-like finish, as had my chair, which I\nnearly slid out of. When I went into the treatment room I found the shiniest,\ncleanest chrome-plated cup holder I had ever seen nestled in its receptacle. I\nhad given my charwoman a fine reputation to live up to, and because of this\nsmall gesture she outperformed all her past efforts. How much additional\ntime did she spend on this? That’s right – none at all.’\nThere is an old saying: ‘Give a dog a bad name and you may as well\nhang him.’ But give him a good name – and see what happens!\nWhen Mrs. Ruth Hopkins, a fourth-grade teacher in Brooklyn, New\nYork, looked at her class roster the first day of school, her excitement and\njoy of starting a new term was tinged with anxiety. In her class this year she\nwould have Tommy T., the school’s most notorious ‘bad boy.’ His third-\ngrade teacher had constantly complained about Tommy to colleagues, the\nprincipal and anyone else who would listen. He was not just mischievous;\nhe caused serious discipline problems in the class, picked fights with the\nboys, teased the girls, was fresh to the teacher, and seemed to get worse as","he grew older. His only redeeming feature was his ability to learn rapidly\nand master the school work easily.\nMrs. Hopkins decided to face the ‘Tommy problem’ immediately.\nWhen she greeted her new students, she made little comments to each of\nthem: ‘Rose, that’s a pretty dress you are wearing,’ ‘Alicia, I hear you draw\nbeautifully.’ When she came to Tommy, she looked him straight in the eyes\nand said, ‘Tommy, I understand you are a natural leader. I’m going to\ndepend on you to help me make this class the best class in the fourth grade\nthis year.’ She reinforced this over the first few days by complimenting\nTommy on everything he did and commenting on how this showed what a\ngood student he was.

The first teacher\nI engaged probably told me the truth. She said I was all wrong; I would just\nhave to forget everything and begin all over again. But that took the heart\nout of me. I had no incentive to go on. So I quit her.\n‘The next teacher may have been lying, but I liked it. She said\nnonchalantly that my dancing was a bit old-fashioned perhaps, but the\nfundamentals were all right, and she assured me I wouldn’t have any\ntrouble learning a few new steps. The first teacher had discouraged me by\nemphasising my mistakes. This new teacher did the opposite. She kept\npraising the things I did right and minimising my errors. “You have a\nnatural sense of rhythm,” she assured me. “You really are a natural-born\ndancer.” Now my common sense tells me that I always have been and\nalways will be a fourth-rate dancer; yet, deep in my heart, I still like to think\nthat maybe she meant it. To be sure, I was paying her to say it; but why\nbring that up?\n‘At any rate, I know I am a better dancer than I would have been if she\nhadn’t told me I had a natural sense of rhythm. That encouraged me. That\ngave me hope. That made me want to improve.’\nTell your child, your spouse, or your employee that he or she is stupid\nor dumb at a certain thing, has no gift for it, and is doing it all wrong, and\nyou have destroyed almost every incentive to try to improve. But use the\nopposite technique – be liberal with your encouragement, make the thing\nseem easy to do, let the other person know that you have faith in his ability\nto do it, that he has an undeveloped flair for it – and he will practise until\nthe dawn comes in the window in order to excel.","Lowell Thomas, a superb artist in human relations, used this technique.\nHe gave you confidence, inspired you with courage and faith. For example,\nI spent a weekend with Mr. and Mrs. Thomas; and on Saturday night, I was\nasked to sit in on a friendly bridge game before a roaring fire. Bridge? Oh,\nno! No! Not me. I knew nothing about it. The game had always been a\nblack mystery to me. No! No! Impossible!\n‘Why, Dale, it is no trick at all,’ Lowell replied. ‘There is nothing to\nbridge except memory and judgement. You’ve written articles on memory.\nBridge will be a cinch for you. It’s right up your alley.’\nAnd presto, almost before I realised what I was doing, I found myself\nfor the first time at a bridge table. All because I was told I had a natural flair\nfor it and the game was made to seem easy.\nSpeaking of bridge reminds me of Ely Culbertson, whose books on\nbridge have been translated into a dozen languages and have sold more than\na million copies. Yet he told me he never would have made a profession out\nof the game if a certain young woman hadn’t assured him he had a flair for\nit.\nWhen he came to America in 1922, he tried to get a job teaching in\nphilosophy and sociology, but he couldn’t.\nThen he tried selling coal, and he failed at that.\nThen he tried selling coffee, and he failed at that, too.\nHe had played some bridge, but it had never occurred to him in those\ndays that someday he would teach it. He was not only a poor card player,\nbut he was also very stubborn. He asked so many questions and held so\nmany post-mortem examinations that no one wanted to play with him.\nThen he met a pretty bridge teacher, Josephine Dillon, fell in love and\nmarried her. She noticed how carefully he analysed his cards and persuaded\nhim that he was a potential genius at the card table. It was that\nencouragement and that alone, Culbertson told me, that caused him to make\na profession of bridge.\nClarence M. Jones, one of the instructors of our course in Cincinnati,\nOhio, told how encouragement and making faults seem easy to correct\ncompletely changed the life of his son.\n‘In 1970 my son David, who was then fifteen years old, came to live\nwith me in Cincinnati. He had led a rough life. In 1958 his head was cut\nopen in a car accident, leaving a very bad scar on his forehead. In 1960 his\nmother and I were divorced and he moved to Dallas, Texas, with his mother.","Until he was fifteen he had spent most of his school years in special classes\nfor slow learners in the Dallas school system. Possibly because of the scar,\nschool administrators had decided he was brain-injured and could not\nfunction at a normal level. He was two years behind his age group, so he\nwas only in the seventh grade. Yet he did not know his multiplication tables,\nadded on his fingers and could barely read.\n‘There was one positive point. He loved to work on radio and TV sets.\nHe wanted to become a TV technician. I encouraged this and pointed out\nthat he needed maths to qualify for the training. I decided to help him\nbecome proficient in this subject. We obtained four sets of flash cards:\nmultiplication, division, addition and subtraction. As we went through the\ncards, we put the correct answers in a discard stack. When David missed\none, I gave him the correct answer and then put the card in the repeat stack\nuntil there were no cards left. I made a big deal out of each card he got\nright, particularly if he had missed it previously. Each night we would go\nthrough the repeat stack until there were no cards left. Each night we timed\nthe exercise with a stop watch. I promised him that when he could get all\nthe cards correct in eight minutes with no incorrect answers, we would quit\ndoing it every night. This seemed an impossible goal to David. The first\nnight it took 52 minutes, the second night, 48, then 45, 44, 41, then under\n40 minutes. We celebrated each reduction. I’d call in my wife, and we\nwould both hug him and we’d all dance a jig. At the end of the month he\nwas doing all the cards perfectly in less than eight minutes. When he made\na small improvement he would ask to do it again. He had made the fantastic\ndiscovery that learning was easy and fun.\n‘Naturally his grades in algebra took a jump. It is amazing how much\neasier algebra is when you can multiply. He astonished himself by bringing\nhome a B in maths. That had never happened before. Other changes came\nwith almost unbelievable rapidity. His reading improved rapidly, and he\nbegan to use his natural talents in drawing. Later in the school year his\nscience teacher assigned him to develop an exhibit. He chose to develop a\nhighly complex series of models to demonstrate the effect of levers. It\nrequired skill not only in drawing and model making but in applied\nmathematics. The exhibit took first prize in his school’s science fair and\nwas entered in the city competition and won third prize for the entire city of\nCincinnati.","‘That did it. Here was a kid who had flunked two grades, who had\nbeen told he was “brain-damaged,” who had been called “Frankenstein” by\nhis classmates and told his brains must have leaked out of the cut on his\nhead. Suddenly he discovered he could really learn and accomplish things.\nThe result? From the last quarter of the eighth grade all the way through\nhigh school, he never failed to make the honour roll; in high school he was\nelected to the national honour society. Once he found learning was easy, his\nwhole life changed.’\nIf you want to help others to improve, remember . . .\nPRINCIPLE 8\nUse encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct.","BACK IN 1915, America was aghast. For more than a year, the nations of\nEurope had been slaughtering one another on a scale never before dreamed\nof in all the bloody annals of mankind. Could peace be brought about? No\none knew. But Woodrow Wilson was determined to try. He would send a\npersonal representative, a peace emissary, to counsel with the warlords of\nEurope.\nWilliam Jennings Bryan, secretary of state, Bryan, the peace advocate,\nlonged to go. He saw a chance to perform a great service and make his\nname immortal. But Wilson appointed another man, his intimate friend and\nadviser Colonel Edward M. House; and it was House’s thorny task to break\nthe unwelcome news to Bryan without giving him offence.\n‘Bryan was distinctly disappointed when he heard I was to go to\nEurope as the peace emissary,’ Colonel House records in his diary. ‘He said\nhe had planned to do this himself . . .\n‘I replied that the President thought it would be unwise for anyone to\ndo this officially, and that his going would attract a great deal of attention\nand people would wonder why he was there . . .’\nYou see the intimation? House practically told Bryan that he was too\nimportant for the job – and Bryan was satisfied.\nColonel House, adroit, experienced in the ways of the world, was\nfollowing one of the important rules of human relations: Always make the\nother person happy about doing the thing you suggest.\nWoodrow Wilson followed that policy even when inviting William\nGibbs McAdoo to become a member of his cabinet. That was the highest\nhonour he could confer upon anyone, and yet Wilson extended the\ninvitation in such a way as to make McAdoo feel doubly important. Here is\nthe story in McAdoo’s own words: ‘He [Wilson] said that he was making\nup his cabinet and that he would be very glad if I would accept a place in it\nas Secretary of the Treasury. He had a delightful way of putting things; he","created the impression that by accepting this great honour I would be doing\nhim a favour.’\nUnfortunately, Wilson didn’t always employ such tact. If he had,\nhistory might have been different. For example, Wilson didn’t make the\nSenate and the Republican Party happy by entering the United States in the\nLeague of Nations. Wilson refused to take such prominent Republican\nleaders as Elihu Root or Charles Evans Hughes or Henry Cabot Lodge to\nthe peace conference with him. Instead, he took along unknown men from\nhis own party. He snubbed the Republicans, refused to let them feel that the\nLeague was their idea as well as his, refused to let them have a finger in the\npie; and, as a result of this crude handling of human relations, wrecked his\nown career, ruined his health, shortened his life, caused America to stay out\nof the League, and altered the history of the world.\nStatesmen and diplomats aren’t the only ones who use this make-a-\nperson-happy-to-do-things-you-want-them-to-do-approach. Dale O. Ferrier\nof Fort Wayne, Indiana, told how he encouraged one of his young children\nto willingly do the chore he was assigned.\n‘One of Jeff’s chores was to pick up pears from under the pear tree so\nthe person who was mowing underneath wouldn’t have to stop to pick them\nup. He didn’t like this chore, and frequently it was either not done at all or it\nwas done so poorly that the mower had to stop and pick up several pears\nthat he had missed. Rather than have an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation\nabout it, one day I said to him: “Jeff, I’ll make a deal with you. For every\nbushel basket full of pears you pick up, I’ll pay you one dollar. But after\nyou are finished, for every pear I find left in the yard, I’ll take away a\ndollar. How does that sound?” As you would expect, he not only picked up\nall of the pears, but I had to keep an eye on him to see that he didn’t pull a\nfew off the trees to fill up some of the baskets.’\nI knew a man who had to refuse many invitations to speak, invitations\nextended by friends, invitations coming from people to whom he was\nobligated; and yet he did it so adroitly that the other person was at least\ncontented with his refusal. How did he do it? Not by merely talking about\nthe fact that he was too busy and too-this and too-that. No, after expressing\nhis appreciation of the invitation and regretting his inability to accept it, he\nsuggested a substitute speaker. In other words, he didn’t give the other\nperson any time to feel unhappy about the refusal. He immediately changed","the other person’s thoughts to some other speaker who could accept the\ninvitation.\nGunter Schmidt, who took our course in West Germany, told of an\nemployee in the food store he managed who was negligent about putting the\nproper price tags on the shelves where the items were displayed. This\ncaused confusion and customer complaints. Reminders, admonitions,\nconfrontations with her about this did not do much good. Finally, Mr.\nSchmidt called her into his office and told her he was appointing her\nSupervisor of Price Tag Posting for the entire store and she would be\nresponsible for keeping all of the shelves properly tagged. This new\nresponsibility and title changed her attitude completely, and she fulfilled her\nduties satisfactorily from then on.\nChildish? Perhaps. But that is what they said to Napoleon when he\ncreated the Legion of Honour and distributed 15,000 crosses to his soldiers\nand made eighteen of his generals ‘Marshals of France’ and called his\ntroops the ‘Grand Army.’ Napoleon was criticised for giving ‘toys’ to war-\nhardened veterans, and Napoleon replied, ‘Men are ruled by toys.’\nThis technique of giving titles and authority worked for Napoleon and\nit will work for you. For example, a friend of mine, Mrs. Ernest Gent of\nScarsdale, New York, was troubled by boys running across and destroying\nher lawn. She tried coaxing. Neither worked. Then she tried giving the\nworst sinner in the gang a title and a feeling of authority. She made him her\n‘detective’ and put him in charge of keeping all trespassers off her lawn.\nThat solved her problem. Her ‘detective’ built a bonfire in the backyard,\nheated an iron red hot, and threatened to brand any boy who stepped on the\nlawn.\nThe effective leader should keep the following guidelines in mind\nwhen it is necessary to change attitudes or behaviour:\n1 Be sincere. Do not promise anything that you cannot deliver. Forget\nabout the benefits to yourself and concentrate on the benefits to the\nother person.\n2 Know exactly what it is you want the other person to do.\n3. Be empathetic. Ask yourself what is it the other person really wants.\n4 Consider the benefits that person will receive from doing what you\nsuggest.\n5 Match those benefits to the other person’s wants.","6. When you make your request, put it in a form that will convey to the\nother person the idea that he personally will benefit. We could give a\ncurt order like this: ‘John, we have customers coming in tomorrow and\nI need the stockroom cleaned out. So sweep it out, put the stock in neat\npiles on the shelves and polish the counter.’ Or we could express the\nsame idea by showing John the benefits he will get from doing the\ntask: ‘John, we have a job that should be completed right away. If it is\ndone now, we won’t be faced with it later. I am bringing some\ncustomers in tomorrow to show our facilities. I would like to show\nthem the stock-room, but it is in poor shape. If you could sweep it out,\nput the stock in neat piles on the shelves, and polish the counter, it\nwould make us look efficient and you will have done your part to\nprovide a good company image.’\nWill John be happy about doing what you suggest? Probably not very\nhappy, but happier than if you had not pointed out the benefits. Assuming\nyou know that John has pride in the way his stockroom looks and is\ninterested in contributing to the company image, he will be more likely to\nbe cooperative.

It is reprinted in this edition to give the readers additional\nbackground on Dale Carnegie.\nIt was a cold January night in 1935, but the weather couldn’t keep\nthem away. Two thousand five hundred men and women thronged into the\ngrand ballroom of the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York. Every available\nseat was filled by half-past seven. At eight o’clock, the eager crowd was\nstill pouring in. The spacious balcony was soon jammed. Presently even\nstanding space was at a premium, and hundreds of people, tired after\nnavigating a day in business, stood up for an hour and a half that night to\nwitness – what?\nA fashion show?\nA six-day bicycle race or a personal appearance by Clark Gable?\nNo. These people had been lured there by a newspaper ad. Two\nevenings previously, they had seen this full-page announcement in the New\nYork Sun staring them in the face:\nLearn to Speak Effectively\nPrepare for Leadership\nOld stuff? Yes, but believe it or not, in the most sophisticated town on earth,\nduring a depression with 20 percent of the population on relief, twenty-five\nhundred people had left their homes and hustled to the hotel in response to\nthat ad. The people who responded were of the upper economic strata –\nexecutives, employers and professionals.\nThese men and women had come to hear the opening gun of an\nultramodern, ultrapractical course in ‘Effective Speaking and Influencing\nMen in Business’ – a course given by the Dale Carnegie Institute of\nEffective Speaking and Human Relations.","Why were they there, these twenty-five hundred business men and\nwomen?\nBecause of a sudden hunger for more education because of the\ndepression?\nApparently not, for this same course had been playing to packed\nhouses in New York City every season for the preceding twenty-four years.\nDuring that time, more than fifteen thousand business and professional\npeople had been trained by Dale Carnegie. Even large, sceptical,\nconservative organisations such as the Westinghouse Electric Company, the\nMcGraw-Hill Publishing Company, the Brooklyn Union Gas Company, the\nBrooklyn Chamber of Commerce, the American Institute of Electrical\nEngineers and the New York Telephone Company have had this training\nconducted in their own offices for the benefit of their members and\nexecutives.\nThe fact that these people, ten or twenty years after leaving grade\nschool, high school or college, come and take this training is a glaring\ncommentary on the shocking deficiencies of our educational system.\nWhat do adults really want to study? That is an important question;\nand, in order to answer it, the University of Chicago, the American\nAssociation for Adult Education, and the United Y.M.C.A. Schools made a\nsurvey over a two-year period.\nThat survey revealed that the prime interest of adults is health. It also\nrevealed that their second interest is in developing skill in human\nrelationships – they want to learn the technique of getting along with and\ninfluencing other people. They don’t want to listen to a lot of high-sounding\ntalk about psychology; they want suggestions they can use immediately in\nbusiness, in social contacts and in the home.\nSo that was what adults wanted to study, was it?\n‘All right,’ said the people making the survey. ‘Fine. If that is what\nthey want, we’ll give it to them.’\nLooking round for a textbook, they discovered that no working manual\nhad ever been written to help people solve their daily problems in human\nrelationships.\nHere was a fine kettle of fish! For hundreds of years, learned volumes\nhad been written on Greek and Latin and higher mathematics – topics about\nwhich the average adult doesn’t give two hoots. But on the one subject on","which he has a thirst for knowledge, a veritable passion for guidance and\nhelp – nothing!\nThis explained the presence of twenty-five hundred eager adults\ncrowding into the grand ballroom of the Hotel Pennsylvania in response to\na newspaper advertisement. Here, apparently, at last was the thing for which\nthey had long been seeking.\nBack in high school and college, they had pored over books, believing\nthat knowledge alone was the open sesame to financial and professional\nrewards.\nBut a few years in the rough-and-tumble of business and professional\nlife had brought sharp disillusionment. They had seen some of the most\nimportant business successes won by men who possessed, in addition to\ntheir knowledge, the ability to talk well, to win people to their way of\nthinking, and to ‘sell’ themselves and their ideas.\nThey soon discovered that if one aspired to wear the captain’s cap and\nnavigate the ship of business, personality and the ability to talk are more\nimportant than a knowledge of Latin verbs or a sheepskin from Harvard.\nThe advertisement in the New York Sun promised that the meeting\nwould be highly entertaining. It was.\nEighteen people who had taken the course were marshalled in front of\nthe loudspeaker – and fifteen of them were given precisely seventy-five\nseconds each to tell his or her story. Only seventy-five seconds of talk, then\n‘bang’ went the gavel, and the chairman shouted, ‘Time! Next speaker!’\nThe affair moved with the speed of a herd of buffalo thundering across\nthe plains. Spectators stood for an hour and a half to watch the performance.\nThe speakers were a cross section of life: several sales representatives,\na chain store executive, a baker, the president of a trade association, two\nbankers, an insurance agent, an accountant, a dentist, an architect, a\ndruggist who had come from Indianapolis to New York to take the course, a\nlawyer who had come from Havana in order to prepare himself to give one\nimportant three-minute speech.\nThe first speaker bore the Gaelic name Patrick J. O’Haire. Born in\nIreland, he attended school for only four years, drifted to America, worked\nas a mechanic, then as a chauffeur.\nNow, however, he was forty, he had a growing family and needed more\nmoney, so he tried selling trucks. Suffering from an inferiority complex\nthat, as he put it, was eating his heart out, he had to walk up and down in","front of an office half a dozen times before he could summon up enough\ncourage to open the door. He was so discouraged as a salesman that he was\nthinking of going back to working with his hands in a machine shop, when\none day he received a letter inviting him to an organisation meeting of the\nDale Carnegie Course in Effective Speaking.\nHe didn’t want to attend. He feared he would have to associate with a\nlot of college graduates, that he would be out of place.\nHis despairing wife insisted that he go, saying, ‘It may do you some\ngood, Pat. God knows you need it.’ He went down to the place where the\nmeeting was to be held and stood on the sidewalk for five minutes before he\ncould generate enough self-confidence to enter the room.\nThe first few times he tried to speak in front of the others, he was\ndizzy with fear. But as the weeks drifted by, he lost all fear of audiences and\nsoon found that he loved to talk – the bigger the crowd, the better. And he\nalso lost his fear of individuals and of his superiors. He presented his ideas\nto them, and soon he had been advanced into the sales department. He had\nbecome a valued and much liked member of his company. This night, in the\nHotel Pennsylvania, Patrick O’Haire stood in front of twenty-five hundred\npeople and told a gay, rollicking story of his achievements. Wave after wave\nof laughter swept over the audience. Few professional speakers could have\nequalled his performance.\nThe next speaker, Godfrey Meyer, was a grey-headed banker, the\nfather of eleven children. The first time he had attempted to speak in class,\nhe was literally struck dumb. His mind refused to function. His story is a\nvivid illustration of how leadership gravitates to the person who can talk.\nHe worked on Wall Street, and for twenty-five years he had been\nliving in Clifton, New Jersey. During that time, he had taken no active part\nin community affairs and knew perhaps five hundred people.\nShortly after he had enrolled in the Carnegie course, he received his\ntax bill and was infuriated by what he considered unjust charges. Ordinarily,\nhe would have sat at home and fumed, or he would have taken it out in\ngrousing to his neighbours. But instead, he put on his hat that night, walked\ninto the town meeting, and blew off steam in public.\nAs a result of that talk of indignation, the citizens of Clifton, New\nJersey, urged him to run for the town council. So for weeks he went from\none meeting to another, denouncing waste and municipal extravagance.","There were ninety-six candidates in the field. When the ballots were\ncounted, lo, Godfrey Meyer’s name led all the rest. Almost overnight, he\nhad become a public figure among the forty thousand people in his\ncommunity. As a result of his talks, he made eighty times more friends in\nsix weeks than he had been able to previously in twenty-five years.\nAnd his salary as councilman meant that he got a return of 1,000\npercent a year on his investment in the Carnegie course.\nThe third speaker, the head of a large national association of food\nmanufacturers, told how he had been unable to stand up and express his\nideas at meetings of a board of directors.\nAs a result of learning to think on his feet, two astonishing things\nhappened. He was soon made president of his association, and in that\ncapacity, he was obliged to address meetings all over the United States.\nExcerpts from his talks were put on the Associated Press wires and printed\nin newspapers and trade magazines throughout the country.\nIn two years, after learning to speak more effectively, he received more\nfree publicity for his company and its products than he had been able to get\npreviously with a quarter of a million dollars spent in direct advertising.\nThis speaker admitted that he had formerly hesitated to telephone some of\nthe more important business executives in Manhattan and invite them to\nlunch with him. But as a result of the prestige he had acquired by his talks,\nthese same people telephoned him and invited him to lunch and apologised\nto him for encroaching on his time.\nThe ability to speak is a shortcut to distinction. It puts a person in the\nlimelight, raises one head and shoulders above the crowd. And the person\nwho can speak acceptably is usually given credit for an ability out of all\nproportion to what he or she really possesses.\nA movement for adult education has been sweeping over the nation;\nand the most spectacular force in that movement was Dale Carnegie, a man\nwho listened to and critiqued more talks by adults than has any other man in\ncaptivity. According to a cartoon by ‘Believe-It-or-Not’ Ripley, he had\ncriticised 150,000 speeches. If that grand total doesn’t impress you,\nremember that it meant one talk for almost every day that has passed since\nColumbus discovered America. Or, to put it in other words, if all the people\nwho had spoken before him had used only three minutes and had appeared\nbefore him in succession, it would have taken ten months, listening day and\nnight, to hear them all.","Dale Carnegie’s own career, filled with sharp contrasts, was a striking\nexample of what a person can accomplish when obsessed with an original\nidea and afire with enthusiasm.\nBorn on a Missouri farm ten miles from a railway, he never saw a\nstreetcar until he was twelve years old; yet by the time he was forty-six, he\nwas familiar with the far-flung corners of the earth, everywhere from Hong\nKong to Hammerfest; and at one time, he approached closer to the North\nPole than Admiral Byrd’s headquarters at Little America was to the South\nPole.\nThis Missouri lad who had once picked strawberries and cut\ncockleburs for five cents an hour became the highly paid trainer of the\nexecutives of large corporations in the art of self-expression.\nThis erstwhile cowboy who had once punched cattle and branded\ncalves and ridden fences out in western South Dakota later went to London\nto put on shows under the patronage of the royal family.\nThis chap who was a total failure the first half-dozen times he tried to\nspeak in public later became my personal manager. Much of my success has\nbeen due to training under Dale Carnegie.\nYoung Carnegie had to struggle for an education, for hard luck was\nalways battering away at the old farm in northwest Missouri with a flying\ntackle and a body slam. Year after year, the ‘102’ River rose and drowned\nthe corn and swept away the hay. Season after season, the fat hogs sickened\nand died from cholera, the bottom fell out of the market for cattle and\nmules, and the bank threatened to foreclose the mortgage.\nSick with discouragement, the family sold out and bought another farm\nnear the State Teachers’ College at Warrensburgh, Missouri. Board and\nroom could be had in town for a dollar a day, but young Carnegie couldn’t\nafford it. So he stayed on the farm and commuted on horseback three miles\nto college each day. At home, he milked the cows, cut the wood, fed the\nhogs, and studied his Latin verbs by the light of a coal-oil lamp until his\neyes blurred and he began to nod.\nEven when he got to bed at midnight, he set the alarm for three\no’clock. His father bred pedigreed Duroc-Jersey hogs – and there was\ndanger, during the bitter cold nights, that the young pigs would freeze to\ndeath: so they were put in a basket, covered with a gunny sack, and set\nbehind the kitchen stove. True to their nature, the pigs demanded a hot meal\nat 3 A.M. So when the alarm went off, Dale Carnegie crawled out of the","blankets, took the basket of pigs out to their mother, waited for them to\nnurse, and then brought them back to the warmth of the kitchen stove.\nThere were six hundred students in State Teachers’ College, and Dale\nCarnegie was one of the isolated half-dozen who couldn’t afford to board in\ntown. He was ashamed of the poverty that made it necessary for him to ride\nback to the farm and milk the cows every night. He was ashamed of his\ncoat, which was too tight, and his trousers, which were too short. Rapidly\ndeveloping an inferiority complex, he looked about for some shortcut to\ndistinction. He soon saw that there were certain groups in college that\nenjoyed influence and prestige – the football and baseball players and the\nchaps who won the debating and public-speaking contests.\nRealising that he had no flair for athletics, he decided to win one of the\nspeaking contests. He spent months preparing his talks. He practised as he\nsat in the saddle galloping to college and back; he practised his speeches as\nhe milked the cows; and then he mounted a bale of hay in the barn and with\ngreat gusto and gestures harangued the frightened pigeons about the issues\nof the day.\nBut in spite of all his earnestness and preparation, he met with defeat\nafter defeat. He was eighteen at the time – sensitive and proud. He became\nso discouraged, so depressed, that he even thought of suicide. And then\nsuddenly he began to win, not one contest, but every speaking contest in\ncollege.\nOther students pleaded with him to train them; and they won also.\nAfter graduating from college, he started selling correspondence\ncourses to the ranchers among the sand hills of western Nebraska and\neastern Wyoming. In spite of all his boundless energy and enthusiasm, he\ncouldn’t make the grade. He became so discouraged that he went to his\nhotel room in Alliance, Nebraska, in the middle of the day, threw himself\nacross the bed, and wept in despair. He longed to go back to college, he\nlonged to retreat from the harsh battle of life; but he couldn’t. So he\nresolved to go to Omaha and get another job. He didn’t have the money for\na railroad ticket, so he travelled on a freight train, feeding and watering two\ncarloads of wild horses in return for his passage. After landing in south\nOmaha, he got a job selling bacon and soap and lard for Armour and\nCompany. His territory was up among the Badlands and the cow and Indian\ncountry of western South Dakota. He covered his territory by freight train\nand stage coach and horseback and slept in pioneer hotels where the only","partition between the rooms was a sheet of muslin. He studied books on\nsalesmanship, rode bucking bronchos, played poker with the Indians, and\nlearned how to collect money. And when, for example, an inland\nstorekeeper couldn’t pay cash for the bacon and hams he had ordered, Dale\nCarnegie would take a dozen pairs of shoes off his shelf, sell the shoes to\nthe railroad men, and forward the receipts to Armour and Company.\nHe would often ride a freight train a hundred miles a day. When the\ntrain stopped to unload freight, he would dash uptown, see three or four\nmerchants, get his orders; and when the whistle blew, he would dash down\nthe street again lickety-split and swing onto the train while it was moving.\nWithin two years, he had taken an unproductive territory that had stood\nin the twenty-fifth place and had boosted it to first place among all the\ntwenty-nine car routes leading out of south Omaha. Armour and Company\noffered to promote him, saying: ‘You have achieved what seemed\nimpossible.’ But he refused the promotion and resigned, went to New York,\nstudied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, and toured the country,\nplaying the role of Dr. Harley in Polly of the Circus.\nHe would never be a Booth or a Barrymore. He had the good sense to\nrecognise that. So back he went to sales work, selling automobiles and\ntrucks for the Packard Motor Car Company.\nHe knew nothing about machinery and cared nothing about it.\nDreadfully unhappy, he had to scourge himself to his task each day. He\nlonged to have time to study, to write the books he had dreamed about\nwriting back in college. So he resigned. He was going to spend his days\nwriting stories and novels and support himself by teaching in a night school.\nTeaching what? As he looked back and evaluated his college work, he\nsaw that his training in public speaking had done more to give him\nconfidence, courage, poise and the ability to meet and deal with people in\nbusiness than had all the rest of his college courses put together. So he\nurged the Y.M.C.A. schools in New York to give him a chance to conduct\ncourses in public speaking for people in business.\nWhat? Make orators out of business people? Absurd. The Y.M.C.A.\npeople knew. They had tried such courses – and they had always failed.\nWhen they refused to pay him a salary of two dollars a night, he agreed to\nteach on a commission basis and take a percentage of the net profits – if\nthere were any profits to take. And inside of three years they were paying\nhim thirty dollars a night on that basis – instead of two.","The course grew. Other ‘Ys’ heard of it, then other critics. Dale\nCarnegie soon became a glorified circuit rider covering New York,\nPhiladelphia, Baltimore and later London and Paris. All the textbooks were\ntoo academic and impractical for the business people who flocked to his\ncourses. Because of this he wrote his own book entitled Public Speaking\nand Influencing Men in Business, It became the official text of all the\nY.M.C.A.s as well as of the American Bankers’ Association and the\nNational Credit Men’s Association.\nDale Carnegie claimed that all people can talk when they get mad. He\nsaid that if you hit the most ignorant man in town on the jaw and knock him\ndown, he would get on his feet and talk with an eloquence, heat and\nemphasis that would have rivalled that world famous orator William\nJennings Bryan at the height of his career. He claimed that almost any\nperson can speak acceptably in public if he or she has self-confidence and\nan idea that is boiling and stewing within.\nThe way to develop self-confidence, he said, is to do the thing you fear\nto do and get a record of successful experiences behind you. So he forced\neach class member to talk at every session of the course. The audience is\nsympathetic. They are all in the same boat; and, by constant practice, they\ndevelop a courage, confidence and enthusiasm that carry over into their\nprivate speaking.\nDale Carnegie would tell you that he made a living all these years, not\nby teaching public speaking – that was incidental. His main job was to help\npeople conquer their fears and develop courage.\nHe started out at first to conduct merely a course in public speaking,\nbut the students who came were business men and women. Many of them\nhadn’t seen the inside of a classroom in thirty years. Most of them were\npaying their tuition on the installment plan. They wanted results and they\nwanted them quick – results that they could use the next day in business\ninterviews and in speaking before groups.\nSo he was forced to be swift and practical. Consequently, he developed\na system of training that is unique – a striking combination of public\nspeaking, salesmanship, human relations and applied psychology.\nA slave to no hard-and-fast rules, he developed a course that is as real\nas the measles and twice as much fun.\nWhen the classes terminated, the graduates formed clubs of their own\nand continued to meet fortnightly for years afterwards. One group of","nineteen in Philadelphia met twice a month during the winter season for\nseventeen years. Class members frequently travel fifty or a hundred miles to\nattend classes. One student used to commute each week from Chicago to\nNew York.\nProfessor William James of Harvard used to say that the average\nperson develops only 10 percent of his latent mental ability. Dale Carnegie,\nby helping business men and women to develop their latent possibilities,\ncreated one of the most significant movements in adult education.\nLowell Thomas 1936","This ebook is copyright material and must not be copied, reproduced,\ntransferred, distributed, leased, licensed or publicly performed or used in\nany way except as specifically permitted in writing by the publishers, as\nallowed under the terms and conditions under which it was purchased or as\nstrictly permitted by applicable copyright law.
