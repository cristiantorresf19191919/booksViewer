Neither Dale Carnegie nor the\npublishers, Simon and Schuster, anticipated more than this modest sale. To\ntheir amazement, the book became an overnight sensation, and edition after\nedition rolled off the presses to keep up with the increasing public demand.\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People took its place in publishing\nhistory as one of the all-time international bestsellers. It touched a nerve\nand filled a human need that was more than a faddish phenomenon of post-\nDepression days, as evidenced by its continued and uninterrupted sales into\nthe eighties, almost half a century later.\nDale Carnegie used to say that it was easier to make a million dollars\nthan to put a phrase into the English language. How to Win Friends and\nInfluence People became such a phrase, quoted, paraphrased, parodied,\nused in innumerable contexts from political cartoon to novels. The book\nitself was translated into almost every known written language. Each\ngeneration has discovered it anew and has found it relevant.\nWhich brings us to the logical question: Why revise a book that has\nproven and continues to prove its vigorous and universal appeal? Why\ntamper with success?\nTo answer that, we must realise that Dale Carnegie himself was a\ntireless reviser of his own work during his lifetime. How to Win Friends\nand Influence People was written to be used as a textbook for his courses in\nEffective Speaking and Human Relations and is still used in those courses\ntoday. Until his death in 1955 he constantly improved and revised the\ncourse itself to make it applicable to the evolving needs of an evergrowing\npublic. No one was more sensitive to the changing currents of present-day\nlife than Dale Carnegie. He constantly improved and refined his methods of\nteaching; he updated his book on Effective Speaking several times. Had he\nlived longer, he himself would have revised How to Win Friends and\nInfluence People to better reflect the changes that have taken place in the\nworld since the thirties.",
